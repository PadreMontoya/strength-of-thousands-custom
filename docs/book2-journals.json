She's harsh and is not afraid to share her criticisms of students. However, she is not mean in her intentions, she just has high expectations. Tahenkot wants her students to be putting their best effort towards learning because she certainly is. While her tactics may be brutal, if the moment arises for genuine compliments and praise, Tahenkot is unparalleled in her effect and her approval may mean a lot to students who want to impress her.</p><h2>Teaching Style</h2><p>Tahenkot's lectures do not have a singular topic that relates them all. Instead, the main thing to focus on is the difficulty. She makes classes with copious homework and covers exceedingly high-level material. However, Tahenkot does take interest in history and flight magic. Regardless of the topic, her lectures often task students to question the validity of information being presented as factual and to think critically about topics before making conclusions.</p><h2>Student Relations</h2><p>Meetings with her will involve some amounts of criticism, but she directs her fury mainly onto students like Haibram, Chizire, and Mariama rather than more sensitive students. Her high standards mean that when she does give genuine compliments, they carry significant weight.</p><div data-visibility=\"gm\"><p><strong>GM Note:</strong> Integrate her with care, so as to not make her hated. Izem Mezitani has a major crush on her.</p></div>",

Unlike Koride, whose laid-back attitude is attributed to laziness, Ahassunu is a lizardfolk who is so constantly engrossed in thought that she sometimes forgets her duties. In writing papers and researching history, time will slip by her without notice until several hours have passed and she's forgotten all commitments.</p><p>However, she's not absent-minded by any means and, in stark contrast, is very easily able to remember the history of the Mwangi Expanse in excruciatingly great detail. When she is able to discuss her favorite topics, she does so with gusto and infectious enthusiasm.</p><h2>Teaching & Research</h2><p>Ahassunu is deeply interested in the history of other cultures. Her lectures would involve long discussions on the developments of various nations, cities, and peoples in the Mwangi Expanse and beyond. As such, this lizardfolk is likely incredibly multilingual and, if any students are in one of her language classes, will exclusively speak to them in that language. She will also be able to greet and converse with students in their first languages with the efficacy of a native speaker.</p>",

She's perhaps the most literarily inclined professor at the school and is often found partaking in Nantambu's theaters as both audience member, actor, and director. In addition, she's known for being biting towards students she feels are slacking, preferring sarcastic retorts rather than outright shouting.</p><h2>Teaching Style</h2><p>Nhyira, being a playwright and writer, writes her lectures to feel like mini-plays. She wants her students to experience history and as such makes them reenact crucial sieges, forbidden love between nobles, and monumental political speeches. Her classes tend to employ lots of writing assignments and really focus on blurring the line between literature and history.</p><h2>Student Relations</h2><p>If there are any bards in the group, she's by far the best person to get inspiration from and talk to about their next performance. She has high standards and isn't afraid to use wit and sarcasm to motivate underperforming students.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Nhyira is genderfluid and will express herself differently over the course of the adventure.</p>",
