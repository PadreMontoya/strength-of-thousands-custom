# Year of the Initiate

Welcome to your first year at the Magaambya! As new initiates, your days will be filled with classes, studies, campus activities, and getting to know your fellow students. The academy is vast and there's always something happening - from academic pursuits to social gatherings, from mysterious events to opportunities to help your peers.

You'll take turns selecting locations to visit around campus. Each location offers different opportunities for learning, socializing, or adventure. Remember that building friendships with your fellow students and faculty will serve you well throughout your time here.

## Campus Map

## 1. Welcome Road
This bustling quad area serves as the social heart of campus where students from all branches gather between classes. Comfortable stone benches line the pathways, and the sound of animated discussions fills the air. Students often debate magical theory, share gossip, or organize study groups here.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Event:</strong> Esi Djana and Haibram Thodja are having a heated but friendly debate about whether practical application or theoretical understanding is more important in magical education. They notice the PC and ask them to settle the argument by choosing a side and defending their position. Esi argues for theory ("You need to understand the why before the how!"), while Haibram argues for practice ("The best way to learn magic is to do magic!"). Award the PC a friendship point with whichever NPC they support, or with both if they find a clever compromise.</p>

## 2. Tree-Stump Library
This ancient, massive tree stump has been converted into a library, though it appears to have fallen into disuse. Vines crawl up its weathered exterior, and the windows are dusty and dim. The heavy wooden doors are secured with new-looking locks, and official notices posted nearby indicate the building is temporarily closed for "renovations and safety inspections."

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The library is locked and will be the scene of a future adventure involving Stone Ghost's tunnels. If players try to investigate, they find the doors securely locked and notices warning students to stay away. Any attempts to break in should be discouraged - this is clearly off-limits and will be important later.</p>
</div>

## 3. Storage Barn
This weathered wooden barn sits at the edge of campus, used for storing supplies and equipment.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>GM Notes:</strong> The players previously covered the trap door with barrels during their investigation in Book 1. Now, the barrels have been moved and the trap door is standing open. If they investigate, they can see that someone has been using the tunnels recently - there are fresh footprints in the dust and signs of recent passage. This foreshadows the tunnel network that will become important later in the adventure.</p>
</div>

## 4. Archhorn Library
This impressive stone building houses one of the Magaambya's primary libraries. Tall windows let in natural light to illuminate reading areas filled with comfortable chairs and study tables. The scent of old parchment and magical preservatives fills the air. Students can often be found here researching assignments or preparing for examinations.

**Activities Available:** Study, Cram

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Random Event:</strong> A nervous Uzunjati student named Kesi is balanced precariously on a tall ladder, trying to reach a book from a high shelf about 20 feet up. The ladder is old and one of the rungs has just cracked under her weight. She's frozen with fear, clutching the ladder and calling for help. The PC can assist by steadying the ladder (DC 12 Athletics), using magic to help her down safely, or finding another solution. Kesi is researching "The Symbolic Meanings of Geometric Patterns in Ancient Mwangi Art" and will be very grateful for help, offering to share her research notes (+1 to next Lore check related to Mwangi culture).</p>
</div>

## 5. The Between
This cozy tavern and social hub caters specifically to students and younger faculty. Warm lamplight creates intimate conversation nooks, and the walls are decorated with student artwork and academic achievements. The atmosphere is always lively, with the sound of laughter, debate, and the occasional impromptu musical performance.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Social Event:</strong> Chizire and Mariama are engaged in an increasingly ridiculous drinking contest using Chizire's experimental "flavor-changing" ales. Each drink changes to a different (harmless but bizarre) flavor - current flavors include "wet dog," "grandmother's perfume," and "that thing you stepped in yesterday." Other students are placing bets on who will give up first. The PC can join the contest, place a bet, or try to mediate before things get out of hand. If they participate, they need to make Constitution saves (DC starts at 10, increases by 2 each round) - failure means they're out, but everyone has a good laugh regardless.</p>
</div>

## 6. Elephant Museum (Emerald Boughs Class)
This distinctive building, shaped like a massive elephant, serves as the home base for Emerald Boughs students. The interior is filled with cultural artifacts, diplomatic treaties, and exhibits showcasing the interconnectedness of different societies. Comfortable discussion areas encourage debate and collaborative learning.

**Branch Requirement:** Must be Emerald Bough to attend class

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Class Lesson:</strong> Teacher Zuma leads a discussion on "Recognizing Supernatural Influence in Political Movements." The lesson covers how to identify when extraplanar entities might be manipulating mortal governments.</p>

<p><strong>Trivia Questions for Emerald Bough Students:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"What are the three most common signs that a political leader may be under demonic influence?" (Answer: Sudden personality changes, policies that benefit no one, and an aversion to holy symbols)</li>
<li>"What caused the creation of the Mana Wastes between Geb and Nex?" (Answer: The magical devastation from their ancient war created a region where magic is unpredictable and dangerous)</li>
<li>"Name two diplomatic strategies that work on devils but fail completely on demons." (Answer: Formal contracts and appeals to hierarchy/order)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After Class:</strong> Zuma pulls the student aside and mentions he's been working on a special project. He needs a group of willing volunteers who aren't too far along in their magical studies to help him test a special tattoo ink. He asks the student to bring their friends by his office when convenient to participate in his "Monochrome Murmurs" experiment - a process to magically connect multiple people so they can share thoughts and amplify each other's magical abilities.</p>
</div>

## 7. Warden House (Uzunjati Class)
This welcoming building serves as the social heart for Uzunjati students. The main hall features a large circular seating area perfect for storytelling, with excellent acoustics that carry even whispered tales to every corner. The walls are decorated with artwork from students representing dozens of different cultures.

**Branch Requirement:** Must be Uzunjati to attend class

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Class Assignment:</strong> Teacher Janatimo lectures on "The Power of Indirect Inquiry" - how stories and seemingly casual conversation can reveal more truth than direct questioning. Students are given an assignment to learn three secrets from other people on campus without directly asking for them. The technique involves making incorrect statements that prompt people to correct you with the truth. For example, saying "I heard the dining hall is serving roasted beetle tonight" might prompt someone to correct you with "No, it's honey-glazed plantains with mango sauce" - revealing what's actually being served.</p>

<p><strong>Examples for Practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>"I think Teacher Koride keeps her pet spiders in the Rain-Scribe building" (to learn where she actually keeps them)</li>
<li>"Didn't Chizire get in trouble for brewing in the library?" (to learn where he actually brews)</li>
<li>"I heard the next Starday Tournament is being held indoors" (to learn the actual location)</li>
</ul>
</div>

## 8. Tireless Hall
This grand ceremonial building is named for Golden Snake, the Tireless Guide. The impressive architecture features soaring ceilings and excellent acoustics, making it perfect for large gatherings and important ceremonies. Colorful banners hang from the rafters, and bulletin boards near the entrance are covered with announcements about upcoming events.

Prominent posters advertise the upcoming First Masking ceremony, emphasizing that family members and friends are invited to attend this important milestone in every initiate's academic career.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>NPCs Present:</strong> Anchor Root, Noxolo, and Okoro are excitedly discussing the ceremony.</p>

<p><strong>Conversation Topics:</strong> Ask the PC about their family - who might be coming to the ceremony? Anchor Root mentions she's nervous because her entire clan is traveling here, putting enormous pressure on her. Noxolo is worried her family might track her down despite her attempts to stay hidden. Okoro is excited because his parents are bringing his younger siblings.</p>

<p><strong>Gift Problem:</strong> Tzeniwe approaches looking distressed. She wants to get a special gift for her children (Zachva and Zanvi) to commemorate their mother's First Masking, but she can't find anything appropriate in the campus shops. She's looking for something that represents both her academic achievement and her love for them - perhaps something handmade or magically significant.</p>

<p><strong>Parent Descriptions:</strong> If asked, briefly describe what the NPCs' parents are like - Anchor Root's clan elders are stern but proud, Noxolo's family is loving but controlling, Okoro's parents are enthusiastic academics who encourage his curiosity.</p>
</div>

## 9. Heron Archives (Rain-Scribes Class)
This building resembles a massive heron in flight, with wings that form reading alcoves and a long neck that houses the main archive tower. The interior smells of preserved specimens and natural materials. Display cases showcase the intricate relationships between magical and mundane ecosystems.

**Branch Requirement:** Must be Rain-Scribe to attend class

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Class Lesson:</strong> Teacher Koride lectures on "The Ecological Importance of Decomposer Insects" - focusing on how creatures like beetles, flies, and mites are essential to natural cycles.</p>

<p><strong>Trivia Questions for Rain-Scribe Students:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"Which type of beetle is most effective at breaking down magical plant matter?" (Answer: Thaumic scarabs)</li>
<li>"How do carrion flies help prevent the spread of necromantic energy?" (Answer: They consume tainted flesh before it can animate)</li>
<li>"What happens to an ecosystem when all the decomposer insects are removed?" (Answer: Dead matter accumulates, disease spreads, and the cycle of life breaks down)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After Class:</strong> Koride assigns the student to investigate unusual insect behavior around campus. She's noticed her specimens acting strangely and wants a student to check three locations: the Leshy Gardens, the canal near Speaker's Stage, and the dining hall kitchen. This begins the "Bug Problems" quest.</p>
</div>

## 10. Indigo Hall (Cascade Bearers Class)
This innovative building seems to shift and change its internal layout subtly throughout the day, reflecting the Cascade Bearers' emphasis on adaptation and creativity. The walls are covered with experimental magical diagrams, prototype devices, and works-in-progress from current students.

**Branch Requirement:** Must be Cascade Bearer to attend class

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Class Lesson:</strong> Teacher Takulu leads a discussion on "Imagination as the Foundation of Innovation" - how creative thinking drives magical advancement.</p>

<p><strong>Trivia Questions for Cascade Bearer Students:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>"What mathematical principle underlies most breakthrough magical innovations?" (Answer: Fractal geometry - patterns that repeat at different scales)</li>
<li>"Why do the most successful magical inventors often come from non-magical backgrounds?" (Answer: They're not limited by preconceptions about what's possible)</li>
<li>"What's the relationship between emotional state and creative magical output?" (Answer: Positive emotions enhance creative flow, while stress blocks innovative thinking)</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>After Class:</strong> Takulu mentions he's been trying to compile a reading list of books that inspire creative thinking, but he's having trouble locating several rare texts. He asks the student to help with "Takulu's Reading List" - finding and retrieving specific books from around campus.</p>
</div>

## 11. Shifting Greenhouse
This remarkable botanical facility appears to exist in multiple climates simultaneously. Different sections maintain tropical, temperate, desert, and even arctic conditions through a combination of magical and mundane techniques. Exotic plants from across Golarion thrive in carefully maintained micro-environments, and the air shimmers with protective enchantments.

**Activities Available:** Field Research

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Event:</strong> Mariama is here studying rare plants for her chaos magic research, but she's gotten herself entangled by a Vine Lasher that was supposed to be dormant. The aggressive plant has wrapped its thorny vines around her arms and legs, and she's struggling to break free without triggering the plant's more dangerous defensive mechanisms. She's trying to stay calm but is clearly in distress. The PC can help by either making a DC 15 Nature check to calm the plant, a DC 13 Athletics check to carefully untangle her, or using magic to resolve the situation. Success earns Mariama's gratitude and she shares some insights about chaotic magical phenomena.</p>
</div>

## 12. Whistle Tower
This tall, elegant tower serves as a private retreat and meeting space for faculty and staff. Students are strictly prohibited from entering, though the building's distinctive architecture makes it a prominent landmark on campus. Soft lights can often be seen in the windows during evening faculty meetings.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Event:</strong> As the PC passes by, they notice frantic gesturing from a third-floor window. It's Ignaci, who snuck in to turn in a late assignment but is now trapped because teachers entered the room he needs to cross to reach the exit. He's silently signaling for help from the window. The PC can create a distraction to draw the teachers away, use magic to help him escape, or find another solution. If caught, Ignaci would face serious disciplinary action, so stealth and creativity are key.</p>
</div>

---

## 13. Verdant House
This living building appears to be grown rather than built, with walls of intertwined vines and a roof of flowering branches. It serves as a residence for visiting scholars studying botanical magic and as a meeting place for students interested in plant-based magical research. The interior is cool and green, with natural light filtering through leafy windows.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Event:</strong> Okoro is here conducting an experiment on "plant communication networks" but has accidentally triggered a magical feedback loop. All the plants in the building are now "talking" at once - a cacophony of rustling, creaking, and magical whispers that's giving everyone headaches. He needs help either calming the plants down or finding a way to break the communication link he's established. The solution might involve Nature checks, Plant-related magic, or simply finding the right frequency to "tune out" the noise.</p>
</div>

## 14. Powderpile
The student supply store, affectionately nicknamed for its extensive collection of magical powders and components. The building is run by Xhokan, a meticulous kobold who knows the location and history of every item in his inventory. Shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, filled with everything a student might need for their studies.

In addition to standard supplies, Xhokan stocks a variety of materials for crafting friendship beads - from simple glass and clay to exotic gems and magical components. Students can invest as little or as much as they want in their friendship beads, with prices ranging from a few copper pieces for basic materials to several gold pieces for rare and enchanted components.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Fundraiser:</strong> A large glass jar sits on the counter, already containing about 50 colored beads. A sign reads "Help Support the Leshy Gardens Restoration Project! Each silver piece donated earns you one bead in our raffle. Grand Prize: Wand of Entangling Flora (3rd level, 10 charges)!" Xhokan explains that the leshys accidentally over-fertilized part of their garden and need funds to restore the balance. The drawing will be held at the end of the week.</p>
</div>

## 15. Sparring Field (Tempest-Sun Mages Starday Tournament)
This large, open area near the Leshy Gardens has been cleared and prepared for combat training and tournaments. Wooden practice weapons are stored in nearby racks, and protective barriers can be erected around the fighting area. The field buzzes with excitement whenever Teacher Mafika announces one of his famous tournaments.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Tournament Details:</strong> This location is primarily used for the Starday Tournament event described in the adventure book. If visited outside of tournament time, students might be found practicing combat techniques or Teacher Mafika might be conducting training sessions.</p>
</div>

---

## 16. Leshy Gardens
This wild, overgrown section of campus is home to several leshys who help maintain the magical ecosystem. Winding paths lead through carefully cultivated chaos - areas where nature is allowed to grow freely under the guidance of plant spirits. Students sometimes come here seeking the unique perspective that only plant-based intelligence can provide.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Cricket Theft Adventure:</strong> Chizire has an idea for a new brew, but he needs a special ingredient: rare and magical crickets from Teacher Koride's office insect collection. To get into the office unseen, a hero must succeed at a DC 15 Stealth check (or alternatively, a DC 15 Deception check to Impersonate someone who regularly visits the Heron Archives). A hero can open the tricky latch on the crickets' terrarium with a successful DC 15 Thievery check to Pick a Lock. On a failure at either check, Koride catches the heroes in the act. She has little punishment beyond stern words, as she's busy and doesn't want the distraction of submitting a formal disciplinary complaint, but she magically protects her office so the heroes can't try again. If successful, Chizire whips up his batch of brew - it's a dismal failure from a flavor perspective, but he's able to distill out a stomach-curdling potion of leaping.</p>
</div>

## 17. Spire Dormitory
Your home away from home - this open, airy building houses initiate students in comfortable rooms surrounding a central common area. Four tall spires give the building its name and provide excellent views of the campus. The common areas feature comfortable seating and beautiful mosaics depicting the history of the Magaambya.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Lofty Leap Adventure:</strong> Haibram has built a new, compact hang glider and needs to get as much height as he can to try it out. He knows the Soaring Spire permits impossible leaps from the ground, but he has a plan to go even higher. He asks one of the heroes to leap to the peak of the Soaring Spire and balance there with their fingers interlocked. Haibram will leap into the hero's hands and then propel himself up another 60 feet, taking him more than 100 feet from the ground. The hero providing aid must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check to balance properly and a DC 15 Athletics check to catch and boost Haibram safely. On a failure, both characters fall, but the Soaring Spire's magic ensures they land safely (though embarrassingly) at the base.</p>
</div>

---

## 18. Dining Hall
This large, warm facility serves as both cafeteria and social hub for the entire campus. Handsome mosaics decorate the walls, and the kitchen-warmed air carries the scents of exotic spices and fresh-baked bread. During rainy weather, students and teachers alike gather here to share meals and conversation.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Surprise! Adventure:</strong> Zachva and Zanvi corner the heroes to ask for help in preparing a surprise birthday party for their mother, Tzeniwe. While they leave the particulars to the heroes, they hover incessantly during the planning and decorating process. Their constant bickering and their distracting "help" threaten to derail the party. The heroes can either ask Esi or Noxolo to keep the twins out of trouble (which requires a PC to succeed at a DC 13 Diplomacy check to convince either of them), or a hero who succeeds at a DC 17 Deception check can distract the twins and keep them out of the way. So long as the heroes can plan, the birthday party is a success, much to Tzeniwe's delight. A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check to Sense Motive realizes she wasn't actually surprised but pretends her best to please her children.</p>
</div>

---

## 19. Sun Dormitory
This secondary dormitory building houses students in a layout similar to Spire Dormitory, though with a more open, sun-focused architectural design. Large windows and skylights ensure the building is always bright and cheerful during daylight hours.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Romance Subplot:</strong> Ignaci has been lingering outside the dormitory every day, hoping to catch a glimpse of Okoro, whom he's developed feelings for. He's too nervous to approach Okoro directly and asks the PC for advice or help. The PC can coach him on what to say, arrange a "coincidental" meeting, or help him find a way to express his feelings through a creative gesture that combines Ignaci's love of mysteries with Okoro's research interests.</p>
</div>

---

## 20. Speaker's Stage
This outdoor amphitheater serves as a venue for public lectures, student presentations, and important announcements. The natural acoustics ensure that speakers can be heard clearly even from the back rows, and the setting encourages both formal presentations and impromptu discussions.

<div data-visibility="gm">
<p><strong>Rules Mastery Adventure:</strong> Okoro has managed to get his hands on a new board game, one with incredibly dense and complex rules. He has excitedly requested a few people to play with him to test it ahead of the biweekly game night. To understand the rules, a hero must succeed at a DC 14 Occultism or Society check to Decipher Writing. On a critical success, the hero realizes that the rules reference page is a cipher concealing a scroll of augury. Any player who succeeds at a DC 18 Occultism or Society check to Recall Knowledge wins the game. Okoro is impressed with any hero that finds the scroll hidden in the instructions and lets them keep that page.</p>
</div>
