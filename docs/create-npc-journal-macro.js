<p><strong>N | female | ant gnoll | bonekeeper-in-training</strong></p>
<p><strong>Branch:</strong> Rain-Scribes<br>
<strong>Notable Skills:</strong> Nature, Occultism, Stealth, Survival<br>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> sand sculptures, raising beetles, musical curation</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Anchor Root is a 3-foot-tall ant gnoll who resembles an aardwolf more than a deadly carnivore. She hails from the small Redridge clan, several weeks' travel south-west from the Magaambya. Her clan has been in decline for several decades, and Anchor Root is the only child with the potential talent to replace Redridge's aging bonekeeper.</p>
<p>Anchor Root's entire family has placed their hopes on her, leaving her in a constant state of panic. Though she has always had issues with anxiety, the expectations currently placed on her shoulders have left her devastated by even the slightest perceived flaw.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p><strong>Most Well Known For:</strong> interrupting herself halfway through a presentation to exclaim "I'm sorry, I'm boring you" and running out of the room crying</p>
<p><strong>Strangest Quirk:</strong> uses a chicken tied to a stick to keep her room free of unwanted bugs</p>
<p><strong>Common Associates:</strong> Esi (working on music playback magic), Noxolo (scavenging bones), Tzeniwe (stress baking)</p>

<h2>Role & Abilities</h2>
<p>She takes her role as bonekeeper-in-training very seriously, always looking for bones of worthy creatures that can be symbolically adopted by her clan to serve as spiritual mentors and protectors. She also has a hobby of anonymously recording music played around the city and working with other students to play it back on campus.</p>`,

          content: `<h1>Chizire (Cascade Bearer)</h1>
<p><strong>CN | male | catfolk | slacker</strong></p>
<p><strong>Branch:</strong> Cascade Bearers<br>
<strong>Notable Skills:</strong> Crafting, Deception, Diplomacy, Nature<br>
<strong>Hobbies:</strong> brewing, engineering, finding new and exciting ways to avoid work</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chizire spent most of his youth in Kibwe unable to read due to dyslexia. By the time a visiting scholar recognized his condition, Chizire had already embraced the role of slacker and screw-up that had been thrust upon him. Despite this, his keen ability to teach himself magic and science caught the scholar's eye.</p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<p><strong>Most Well Known For:</strong> building a complete moonshine still in his dorm room from scrap</p>
<p><strong>Strangest Quirk:</strong> always knowing the answer when called on despite visibly not paying attention</p>
<p><strong>Common Associates:</strong> Anchor Root (brewing experimental elixirs), Mariama (brewing weird liquors), Okoro (gaming group)</p>

<h2>Role & Abilities</h2>
<p>Chizire thrives at the Magaambya, though he often uses his intelligence for disruptive jokes, complex pranks, and other hijinks. He infuriates most mentors by refusing to make anything of himself, despite clearly understanding lessons better than many peers. His ultimate goal is to enchant one of Nantambu's 10 pillar landmarks to tell bawdy jokes.</p>`,
