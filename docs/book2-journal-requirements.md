# Book 2 Journal Requirements

This document describes a Journal I want to create for Foundry VTT.

Player IDs are below:

GM - Anthony Gill: 6M4FFhxdKoWoOC9z
Player - Scott (Character: Mouse the Minotaur Animist): BVtcoqtR5hDV73fr
Player - Joe (Character: Dorren the Human Magus): Rtjc27Wkzogg0m4w
Player - Emily (Character: Zyshi the Anadi Psychic): QM1wwiuuC4Lkl9dU
Player - Jen (Character: Izzy the Human Dragonblood Sorceror): mLpzP30Ezig8iEjr

The players have started book 2, as outlined in ./data/PZO90169 002-059 Adventure.txt

I want to create two journals, outlined below.  Store the journal files in ./foundry/book2-journals.json

Ensure you only show content that is player friendly.  For GM only content, use content formatted like this:

<div data-visibility="gm">
    <p>Secret Text</p>
</div>

## Maagambya NPCs

Create a page for each of the NPCs in ./data/PZO90169 066-071 Students of the Magaambya.txt
Create a page for each teacher described in the adventure.
Be sure to note the NPC's magic branch in their name.  e.g. "Haibram Thodja (Rain-Scribe)"

The journal should be named "Magaambya NPCs" and should be accessible to all players.

Extended info about NPCs is below:


This is a list of the faculty members of the Magaambya and the role they play in their campaign. Since a lot of these are professors and teachers, I will be referencing information from the "Teachers of the Magaambya" section in "Secrets of the Temple-City," but I will not be reposting the article word-for-word. I checked Paizo's Community Use Policy regarding sharing these types of things and I intend to be "descriptively referencing" these people for a use that is not unlike a wiki. I am not a lawyer, so if this type of post is in violation of their Community Use Policy, then I strongly encourage the mods to remove it.

Cascade Bearers
Cascade Bearers esteem imagination above all else. These are the pioneers of the Magaambya world and work often in developing burgeoning fields. Their research and lectures will consist of blending magic in new mannerisms, spell creation, and innovating fields that have not been previously explored.

Takulu Ot

If kindness and gentle guidance were a person, it'd be Takulu Ot. Well known for his heartwarming stories about his wife and endearing passion for anteaters, Takulu is the type of teacher we all wish we had. He'll often be found in Spire Dormitory checking up on his pupils and getting to know them on a personal level if he can. He'll be a recurring friend that the party can go to for help, guidance, and all around support. Have a couple quick lessons and stories about his wife prepared for when he arrives on scene.

Among the topics he researches(and by extension teaches about) are mathematics, with particular eye on fractal geometry, and pedagogy. He'll ask students to think metacognitively about how they learn, what it means to know something, and generally challenge the way students think about things. His lessons end up feeling therapeutic in nature and have philosophical life lessons woven into them in such a way that students will think about for several days.

Lesedi

An Alijae elf, Lesedi is an intimidating figure despite her small stature. Coming from a culture that formed around fighting demons and other extraplanar threats, she does not accept even the smallest mistakes as they can be lethal when dealing with fiends. Too add to her downright terrifying persona, she seems to have an supernatural sense for what students are doing and the pranks they are planning, giving her an ominous almost-prescient air that's sure to leave some PCs seriously disconcerted. However, despite her outward appearance and demon-bone accessories, Lesedi is best described as sweet and kind. She's quick to offer praise moments after eviscerating a student for mispronouncing an incantation.

Lesedi researches all things extraplanar. If anyone wants to travel beyond the Material Plane, she's the leading expert to talk to. She'll have information not just on how to get there, but how to handle the denizens, what to expect, and all around how to survive. Lesedi does not just study the fiendish end of extraplanars but is more than knowledgeable on celestials, monitors, and all sorts of outsiders. Even more than that, she's researching into interstellar expeditions. She was alive for the launch of Lirgen's Glory and is still upset from the tragedy. Involve her in the plot lines for when the party heads off to Akiton as she'll surely take great interest in such an event.

Emerald Boughs
The Emerald Boughs branch is a branch of social sciences and cultural study. They're the branch of diplomats, politicians, and community leaders. How magic is integrated into such a topic is beyond me, but I suspect that many lectures discuss different cultural approaches to magic and the enchantment school

Zuma

Zuma is the only Emerald Boughs professor listed in the currently published modules. He is a very eccentric fellow interested in devils and their infiltration into Golarion's governments. However, his study devolves into conspiracy more times than not as he tends to see the machinations of such beings everywhere. He is certainly the professor the PCs will look to if they have questions about topics no one else can answer but is an unreliable source. Due to the gravity of the ideas he comes up with, Zuma tends to be overzealous and "passionate" about sharing his conspiracy theories and attempts to involve his students and colleagues in his ramblings. He works amazingly if you need to introduce a zany side-quest or actual devil infiltration.

Zuma's study into devil-worshipping cults and conspiracies has him paranoid. As such, his lessons are rambling discussions on how to best protect oneself. However, he is not proposing tinfoil hats, or at least he doesn't stop there. Zuma is an expert in abjuration and defensive magics. He'll know how to prevent charm effects, recover lost knowledge, fend off scrying, and more. Due to the copious threats that'd use beguiling and manipulative magics, Zuma's knowledge is not to be overlooked.

Rain-Scribes
In my opinion, the Rain-Scribes are the most confusing and vague branch of the bunch. Described as the branch of adaptability, you'd expect something more akin to the Cascade Bearers, however they tend to focus more on the natural world and survivalism. Their magic would likely derive heavily from the primal tradition and focus largely on adapting, like many animals, to one's environment.

Koride Ulawa

At her worst, Koride is lazy, biting, and cruel. She's quick to respond to perceived slights with quips of her own but slow to attend to her own classes. Her punishments towards students is excessive, embarassing, and devoid of kindness, but her approach to her own mistakes is forgiving and forgetful. However, Koride is not uniquely villainous. She's a very fun teacher who's happy to tell jokes and share in pranks. Furthermore, she's genuinely passionate about bugs and the field of entomology, often keeping many as pets. There is a suggestion that she will be discussed further in an article from the currently unpublished *"*Shadows of the Ancients"

Koride is well-known for her lackadaisical approach to teaching. However, she does enjoy teaching about bugs and seems to have a particular interest in detritovores. Koride feels such bugs are underappreciated by many cultures who fail to see the value and necessity of such animals in the web of life.

Izem Mezitani

Izem is a more adventurer than professor. Being an aasimar, he is intelligent to an almost inhuman degree, having several doctorates in several nations. However, he is not usually present at the Magaambya for long, spending most of his time on expeditions and archaeological recoveries. Unlike many other professors, Izem likely has hands on experience with fighting fiends and other threats to humanity. He's not a retired adventurer that settled down to become a barkeep, he is an active adventurer who is likely working on some major quest or recovering from his last one. Use him sparingly so as not to overshadow the party's grand adventures. He also has a major crush on Tahenkot and is uncharacteristically anxious. This small detail is very cute and juxtaposes very nicely with his otherwise demigod capability. If you have a good chance to include it, do so.

Izem's expertise is so incredibly broad that he makes a great teacher for information you can't fit elsewhere. He's lectures would be of particular use for the PCs as they often include first-hand recounts of his escapades. However, he might not be the best professor from an academic standpoint as his lectures would often be derailed by these lengthy stories. Again, care must be taken so as not to overshadow the party's accomplishments and adventures. Instead, make sure to have him on these adventures more often than not so he can conveniently not solve the problems for the PCs.

Tempest-Sun Mages
Protectors of Nantambu and defenders of valor, the Tempest-Sun Mages are as close as you can get to superheroes. This branch is the most overt in fighting evil and are a perfect fit for more martially focused characters. If you want to introduce more combat, this branch is most likely to send the party on "research expeditions" of a more martial nature.

Mafika Ayuwari

Mafika is a reference to the Fist of the Ruby Phoenix AP so more information might be present there. What is discussed in this AP indicates that Mafika indicates to me that he is a bit like Kronk from The Emperorer's New Groove. He's focused on his physical and mental well-being. He is an incredible athlete and is likely working out constantly. Mafika encourages his students to take care of themselves, but not in a toxic gym-rat manner, but more of a gym-bro style. He's concerned when students skip meals and don't sleep well, taking issue with a lot of the stereotypical college student lifestyle. Ever the caring instructor, Mafika is likely to provide healthy food, notably noodles and soup, to his classes and include tips on how to stay fit.

Mafika's line of expertise is simply martial arts. His magic pertains towards combat and involves a lot of sparring matches. If the school has any major sports, Mafika is surely involved and shamelessly promoting student engagement. This includes non-competitive sports such as rock-climbing, various forms of boating and swimming, dancing, and more. However, his lectures are interrupted in a similar manner to Izem by anecdotes of his latest escapades.

Tahenkot

Tahenkot is the stereotypical strict teacher. She's harsh and is not afraid to share her criticisms of students. Meetings with her will involve some amounts of berating, but that is best kept to a minimum as it is not fun to be yelled at. Instead, direct her fury onto other students such as Haibram, Chizire, and Mariama. If you really want your group to hate her, have her berate Anchor Root. However, she is not mean in her intentions, she just has high expectations. Tahenkot wants her students to be putting their best effort towards learning because she certainly is. While her tactics may be brutal, if the moment arises for genuine compliments and praise, Tahenkot is unparalleled in her effect and her approval may mean a lot to PCs who want to impress her. Integrate her with care, so as to not make her hated.

Tahenkot's lectures do not have a singular topic that relates them all. Instead, the main thing to focus on is the difficulty. She makes the classes with copious homework and covers exceedingly high-level material. However, Tahenkot does take interest in history and flight magic. Regardless of the topic, her lectures often task students to question the validity of information being presented as factual and to think critically about topics before making conclusions

Uzunjati
The Uzunjati branch is the most artistic branch of scholarship in the Magaambya. It's the branch of playrights, writers, and artists, but also one of historians and diplomats. At its most basic, the Uzunjati deal with expression of oneself through art and storytelling. However, this branch also asks more philosophical questions such as "How does our language effect our thoughts?" and "How does the way we tell history change overtime and across cultures?"

Anhassunu

Anhassunu is characterized by her absent-mindedness and repeated disappearances. Unlike Koride, who's laid-back attitude is attributed to laziness, Anhassunu is a lizardfolk who is so constantly engrossed in thought that she sometimes forgets her duties. In writing papers and researching history, time will slip by her without notice until several hours have passed and she's forgotten all commitments, especially those asked by the party. However, she's not dumb by any means and, in stark contrast, is very easily able to remember the history of the Mwangi Expanse in excruciatingly great detail. When she is able to discuss her favorite topics, she does so with gusto and infectious enthusiasm.

Anhassunu is deeply interested in the history of other cultures. Her lectures would involve long discussions on the developments of various nations, cities, and peoples in the Mwangi Expanse and beyond. As such, this lizardfolk is likely incredibly multilingual and, if any students are in one of her language classes, will exclusively speak to them in that language. She will also be able to greet and converse with PCs and other students in their first languages with the efficacy of a native speaker.

Nhyria (I will be using female pronouns for her as that is what is used in the article but she is genderfluid and as such will express herself differently over the course of the adventure)

Nhyria is well known as the Magaambya's main playwright and writer. She's perhaps the most literarily inclined professor at the school and is often found partaking in Nantambu's theaters as both audience member, actor, and director. In addition, she's known for being biting towards students she feels are slacking. While the book suggests that she'll go as far as shouting at students, this to me feels uncharacteristic of a teacher so well-spoken. Rather, I prefer sarcastic retorts the books suggests she employs. If you have any bards in your party, she's by and far away the best person to get inspiration from and talk to about their next performance.

Nhyria, being a playwright and writer, writes her lectures to feel likely mini-plays. She wants her students to experience history and as such makes them reenact crucial sieges, forbidden love between nobles, and monumental political speeches. Her classes tend to employ lots of writing assignments and really focus on blurring the line between literature and history.

Janatimo

Janatimo is mentioned more in the Lost Omens: Legends setting book, but I do not own that book. However, he is the current head of the Uzunjati branch and as such is a manifestation of their ideals. He's very kind and often keen to hear stories that the PCs have and come up with. He's a listener, not a speaker, but can certainly spin a tale when necessary. Janatimo has way of making students question what they hear and how they hear it, encouraging everyone to dig deeper into the stories they hear.

Other Staff Members
https://paizo.com/community/blog/v5748dyo6shsn

Lumusi Yao is a kindly chef who cares about the health of the Magaambya. She is nearly constantly cooking however and is rarely seen away from the kitchen, after all she does have to feed the whole school. You can find more information on her in the blog post linked above.

Xhokan is incredibly organized and meticulous. He knows everything coming into his store and going out. He'll have records about where it came from, how long he's had it, what quality it is, any and all hazards related to it and all around too much information for most students. He is also referenced in the blog post.

Thema is the most senior landscaper in the Magaambya. She likely takes care of the leshy gardens and shifting greenhouse. Otherwise, there is not a whole lot to say about her that is not referenced in the blog post.

High-Sun Mage Oyamba is the Magaambya's current leader. While plays a significant role in later books, he is never given too much screen time and serves largely as a quest-giver. What characterization we do have of him suggests he's graceful and charismatic.
