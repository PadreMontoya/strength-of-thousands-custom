# Book 2 Journal Requirements

This document describes a Journal I want to create for Foundry VTT.

Player IDs are below:

GM - Anthony Gill: 6M4FFhxdKoWoOC9z
Player - Scott (Character: Mouse the Minotaur Animist): BVtcoqtR5hDV73fr
Player - Joe (Character: Dorren the Human Magus): Rtjc27Wkzogg0m4w
Player - Emily (Character: Zyshi the Anadi Psychic): QM1wwiuuC4Lkl9dU
Player - Jen (Character: Izzy the Human Dragonblood Sorceror): mLpzP30Ezig8iEjr

The players have started book 2, as outlined in ./data/PZO90169 002-059 Adventure.txt

I want to create a journal called Year of the Initiate, outlined below.  For now let's draft the journal as a markdown file called book2-year-of-the-initiate.draft.md

Ensure you only show content that is player friendly.  For GM only content, use content formatted like this:

<div data-visibility="gm">
    <p>Secret Text</p>
</div>

Below are the pages I want in the document, along with instructions for you, GPT, to develop.  On all locations, create a player friendly description of the location, and include secret GM instructions within a <div data-visibility="gm"> tag.  Do not hint to the player about what is happening within that location.

Output the content intended to the journal to a separate markdown file so I can preview it before turning it into JSON.

### Year of the Initiate

Describe to the players that it is their first year in the Magaambya and times are busy.  They will take turns selecting locations to visit.
