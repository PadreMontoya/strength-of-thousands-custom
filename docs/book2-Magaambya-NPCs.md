## Student NPCs

### Anchor Root (Rain-Scribe)
**N | female | ant gnoll | bonekeeper-in-training**

**Branch:** Rain-Scribes  
**Notable Skills:** Nature, Occultism, Stealth, Survival  
**Hobbies:** sand sculptures, raising beetles, musical curation

#### Description
Anchor Root is a 3-foot-tall ant gnoll who resembles an aardwolf more than a deadly carnivore. She hails from the small Redridge clan, several weeks' travel south-west from the Magaambya. Her clan has been in decline for several decades, with important storytellers and religious leaders dying before suitable replacements could be trained. Anchor Root is the only child in the clan with the potential talent to replace Redridge's aging bonekeeper.

Anchor Root's entire family has placed their hopes on the young gnoll—unfortunately, Anchor Root's temperament is ill-suited to such pressure. Though she has always had issues with anxiety, the expectations currently placed on her shoulders have left her in a constant state of panic. The slightest flaw in her work or actions, whether real or perceived, can leave Anchor Root a devastated wreck for days.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** interrupting herself halfway through a presentation to exclaim "I'm sorry, I'm boring you" and running out of the room crying
**Strangest Quirk:** uses a chicken tied to a stick to keep her room free of unwanted bugs
**Common Associates:** Esi (working on music playback magic), Noxolo (scavenging bones), Tzeniwe (stress baking)

#### Key Character Traits
**Shy • Hesitant • Apologetic • Lacks Confidence • Introvert**

#### Things Anchor Root Might Say
- *"Oh! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to— I was just— never mind, it's probably not important anyway..."* (trails off and looks down)
- *"My clan elders always say that a good bonekeeper listens more than they speak, so I try to... well, I probably talk too much already, don't I?"*
- *"I found this really interesting bone fragment yesterday, but you probably don't want to hear about that... unless you do? No, sorry, I shouldn't assume..."*

**Speech Mannerism:** Frequently apologizes and second-guesses herself mid-sentence, often trailing off or asking for permission to continue speaking.

**Physical Mannerism:** Looks down and sweeps her foot in small arcs when nervous or embarrassed.

#### Role & Abilities
Anchor Root takes her role as bonekeeper-in-training very seriously, even though she isn't sure she's up to the task. She is always on the lookout for the bones of worthy creatures—gnolls or otherwise—that can be symbolically adopted by her troubled clan to serve as spiritual mentors and protectors. The gnoll also has a hobby of anonymously recording music played around the city and then working with other students to play back the music on campus for others to hear.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A small carved bone bead shaped like a tiny gnoll skull with musical notes etched along the jawline.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- If you bring bones to Anchor Root, she can divine information from them
- +1 to Study rolls for Rain-Scribe branch subjects (stacks with other Rain-Scribe friends)

### Chizire (Cascade Bearer)
**CN | male | catfolk | slacker**

**Branch:** Cascade Bearers  
**Notable Skills:** Crafting, Deception, Diplomacy, Nature  
**Hobbies:** brewing, engineering, finding new and exciting ways to avoid work

#### Description
Chizire spent most of his youth in Kibwe unable to read, no matter how many books he was given or how many lessons were drilled into his head. By the time a visiting scholar encountered Chizire and recognized the youth was dyslexic, Chizire had already embraced the role of slacker and screw-up that had been thrust upon him. Despite this, Chizire's keen ability to teach himself magic and science caught the scholar's eye, even if the catfolk mostly used his gifts to keep slugs out of his fermentation barrels.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** building a complete moonshine still in his dorm room from scrap
**Strangest Quirk:** always knowing the answer when called on despite visibly not paying attention
**Common Associates:** Anchor Root (brewing experimental elixirs), Mariama (brewing weird liquors), Okoro (gaming group)

#### Key Character Traits
**Clever • Lazy • Mischievous • Sarcastic • Underachiever**

#### Things Chizire Might Say
- *"Oh, that? Yeah, I figured that out weeks ago. Didn't think it was worth mentioning."* (shrugs casually while tinkering with something)
- *"You know what this campus really needs? A distillery. For... educational purposes, obviously."*
- *"I could solve that problem for you, but where's the fun in that? Half the entertainment is watching everyone else struggle with it first."*

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks with casual confidence and dry humor, often while appearing to be distracted by whatever he's building or fixing.

**Physical Mannerism:** Picks his teeth with a claw while thinking or when he's being deliberately obtuse.

#### Role & Abilities
Chizire thrives at the Magaambya, though he often uses his intelligence for disruptive jokes, complex pranks, and other hijinks disapproved of by the faculty. He infuriates most of his mentors—and some of the students—by refusing to make anything of himself, despite clearly understanding the lessons better than many of his peers.

Chizire is known for his daring antics, such as infiltrating the kitchen or stealing magic items from campus, but his ultimate goal for the year is to enchant one of Nantambu's 10 pillar landmarks to tell bawdy jokes. Getting past all the magical wards on the pillars would be an incredible challenge, but Chizire thinks he can manage it with a bit of help, provided no one snitches on him to the teachers.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A glass bead shaped like a tiny distillation apparatus with swirling, color-changing liquid inside.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Chizire can potentially transform a potion into another potion of equal or lesser level (GM's discretion)
- +1 to Study rolls for Cascade Bearer branch subjects (stacks with other Cascade Bearer friends)

**Topics Chizire Can Help With:**
- Alchemical brewing and fermentation
- Engineering and mechanical devices
- Campus prank planning and execution
- Dyslexia coping strategies
- Cascade Bearer innovation techniques

**Hobbies:** university administration, campus exploration, book printing, book binding, sports, tactical wargames, fashion contests

#### Description
Every school has its star students, and anyone who knows Esi Djana knows that she's one of them. A Nantambu native, Esi engages the academy with an energy few can match. On any given day, Esi can be found organizing students for study groups and extracurricular activities, commanding the field for several of Nantambu's sports teams, independently researching foreign policy and military defense tactics, and still finding time for an active social life and dates with similarly ambitious young men.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** once spent 15 straight minutes reciting different synonyms for "wrong" to make a point in an argument
**Strangest Quirk:** leaving baubles at magically derived coordinates for others to find

#### Key Character Traits
**Energetic • Driven • Perfectionist • Social • Competitive**

#### Things Esi Djana Might Say
- *"That's a fantastic idea! We should definitely organize a study group for that. I know exactly who we need to invite, and I can get us a room in the library by tomorrow."*
- *"I've been thinking about this problem all week, and I have seventeen different approaches we could try. Want to hear them? Actually, let me just show you my notes..."*
- *"You know what? You're absolutely right, and I was completely, utterly, thoroughly, and categorically wrong about that. Thank you for correcting me!"*

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks rapidly with enthusiasm, often using multiple adjectives and immediately jumping into action plans or detailed explanations.

**Physical Mannerism:** Gestures emphatically with both hands and leans forward when making a point.

#### Role & Abilities
Esi is also known around campus for being kind, passionate, and genuine, going out of her way to approach shier or more anxious students who seem to have trouble making friends. Determined to follow in the footsteps of famous Tempest-Sun Mages and make her mark on history, Esi has sometimes been known to make enemies of those who can't match her drive and energy. While some students look up to her (or perhaps most of all), others can be dismissive or outright hostile.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Can introduce you to anyone on campus and give you +2 to Diplomacy with them, if she agrees with your motives

### Haibram Thodja (Rain-Scribe)
**CG | male | dwarf | daredevil**

**Branch:** Rain-Scribes  
**Notable Skills:** Arcana, Athletics, Intimidation, Survival  
**Hobbies:** recreational combat, cloud-watching, hang-gliding, pyromania

#### Description
Haibram's philosophy in life could be summed up as "go hard or go home." Though on the whole a friendly person, the Mbe'ke dwarf approaches anything resembling a competition with perhaps a little too much enthusiasm. While most of his idiosyncrasies are harmless, such as entering footraces in full battle armor, others demonstrate a rash impulsiveness, such as the time he leapt out brandishing an axe during an Uzunjati scary story competition.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** jumping off a three-story building to win a game of tag
**Strangest Quirk:** constantly found at the scene of fires that are actually never his fault
**Common Associates:** Chizire (drinking partner), Esi and Mariama (sparring partners)

#### Key Character Traits
**Reckless • Enthusiastic • Impulsive • Friendly • Daredevil**

#### Things Haibram Thodja Might Say

- *"That's not dangerous, that's just... enthusiastic! Come on, where's your sense of adventure?"*
- *"I've got a brilliant idea! It's probably completely insane, but that's what makes it brilliant, right?"*

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks with boisterous enthusiasm and often gestures wildly, frequently suggesting increasingly dangerous "fun" activities.

**Physical Mannerism:** Cracks his knuckles loudly before attempting anything physical or when he's excited about a challenge.

#### Role & Abilities
For those who aren't put off by his wild antics, Haibram can be the highlight of any party. Whether it's rock-climbing, competitive eating, or magical dueling, he approaches everything with boundless energy and enthusiasm. His magic focuses on movement and mobility, allowing him to leap great distances, move with incredible speed across the battlefield, or add hurricane force to thrown mambeles and swung clubs.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A volcanic glass bead shaped like a storm cloud with a lightning bolt frozen inside.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Will wingman almost any raucous activity on campus, if asked
- +1 to Study rolls for Rain-Scribe branch subjects (stacks with other Rain-Scribe friends)

**Topics Haibram Can Help With:**

### Ignaci Canterells (Emerald Bough)
**N | male | human | thaumaturge**

**Branch:** Emerald Boughs  
**Notable Skills:** Crafting, Society, Stealth, Thievery  
**Hobbies:** cryptography, high fashion, covert explorations

#### Description
Born in the colony of Sargava before it became the nation of Vidrian, Ignaci earned his parents' disapproval through the company he kept—rebellious youths, disaffected soldiers, and the native Mwangi populace. This minor rebellion proved enough for Ignaci's colonist family to abandon him at the start of the Vidric Revolution, deliberately stranding the teenager amid the violent chaos.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** being easily swayed into bad decisions by attractive men
**Strangest Quirk:** starting his assignments over from the beginning every time he makes a mistake
**Common Associates:** Chizire (brewing experimental elixirs), Noxolo and Tzeniwe (sewing clothing), Okoro (cleaning house in card games, being talked into bad decisions)

#### Key Character Traits
**Mysterious • Perfectionist • Secretive • Analytical • Romantic**

#### Things Ignaci Canterells Might Say
- *"There's definitely more to this than meets the eye. The pattern suggests... well, I probably shouldn't say more until I'm certain."* (glances around conspiratorially)
- *"I need to start this whole project over. I made one small error on page three, and now the entire thing is compromised."*
- *"The Cryptic Circle has been investigating some... interesting developments around campus. I can't share details, but let's just say things aren't always what they seem."*

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks in measured, careful tones and often hints at secrets or mysteries without revealing details, frequently pausing to consider his words.

**Physical Mannerism:** Adjusts his collar or sleeves when he's being evasive or hiding something.

#### Role & Abilities
Ignaci joined the fight for Vidrian's freedom, in part for justice but mainly driven by a hatred of his family and everyone like them. At the Magaambya, he's found a place where his skills in investigation and puzzle-solving are valued. He's formed a small group called the Cryptic Circle that is dedicated to solving mysteries around campus, though the mysteries they tackle tend to be more significant than simple pranks or missing items.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A crystalline bead with shifting geometric patterns and symbols that rearrange when viewed from different angles.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- +2 to assist with decoding mysterious messages or symbols
- +1 to Study rolls for Emerald Bough branch subjects (stacks with other Emerald Bough friends)

**Topics Ignaci Can Help With:**
- Cryptography and code-breaking
- Campus mysteries and hidden secrets
- Vidrian Revolution history and politics

### Mariama Keitana (Cascade Bearer)
**CN | female | human | chaos magnet**

**Branch:** Cascade Bearers  
**Notable Skills:** Deception, Intimidation, Occultism, Religion  
**Hobbies:** combat theory, occult lore, linguistics

#### Description
Teachers at the Magaambya tactfully describe Mariama as a student with an "interesting" personality. Undeniably a knowledgeable occultist and accomplished spellcaster, the young woman falters between responsibility and unreliability with infuriating frequency. Her attitude likewise flips between unbearable kindness to her friends and outright viciousness to her foes.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** summoning a devil on accident during a routine lesson
**Strangest Quirk:** knows swear words in almost every language on Golarion
**Common Associates:** Chizire (brewing weird liquors), Okoro (board games), Esi and Haibram (sparring partners)

#### Key Character Traits
**Unpredictable • Passionate • Volatile • Knowledgeable • Chaotic**

#### Things Mariama Keitana Might Say
- *"Oh, that reminds me of the time I accidentally opened a portal to the Abyss during breakfast! Or was it the Shadow Plane? Either way, the toast was ruined."*
- *"By the seven hells of Dis!"* (immediately switches to a completely different language) *"Verdammt noch mal! Putain! Sorry, I get excited and start mixing languages."*
- *"Trust me, when weird magical things start happening, you want me around. I have a sixth sense for supernatural chaos... probably because I cause so much of it."*

**Speech Mannerism:** Frequently switches between languages mid-sentence, especially when excited or frustrated, and tells wild stories that may or may not be entirely true.

**Physical Mannerism:** Runs her hands through her hair when frustrated or when magical chaos is happening around her.

#### Mariama's Multilingual Swearing
- *"By the seven hells of Dis!"* (Common)
- *"Verdammt noch mal!"* (Hallit - "Damn it all!")
- *"Putain de merde!"* (Kelish - "F***ing s***!")
- *"¡Maldita sea!"* (Polyglot - "Damn it!")
- *"Che cazzo!"* (Taldane variant - "What the hell!")
- *"Kurwa mać!"* (Skald - Polish-inspired expletive)
- *"Perkele!"* (Ulfen - Finnish-inspired curse)
- *"Блядь!"* (Hallit variant - Russian-inspired)
- *"Scheisse und Zwiebeln!"* (Hallit - "S*** and onions!")

#### Role & Abilities
Mariama lives the kind of life that even storytellers might consider unrealistic, with wildly fluctuating luck and outlandish events frequently plaguing her. She likes to tell stories about these incidents, though she has a tendency to embellish them to the point where even her closest friends aren't sure what really happened. Yet when uncanny forces truly are at work, Mariama's insights are frighteningly accurate.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A chaotic swirl of different colored glass that shifts and changes patterns unpredictably.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- +2 to assist with Occultism checks when interpreting chaotic magical phenomena
- +1 to Study rolls for Cascade Bearer branch subjects (stacks with other Cascade Bearer friends)

**Topics Mariama Can Help With:**
- Chaos magic and unpredictable spells
- Supernatural phenomena detection
- Combat theory and strategy
- Multilingual profanity and slang
- Cascade Bearer innovation methods
- Dealing with wildly fluctuating luck

### Noxolo (Uzunjati)
**LN | female | human | augur**

**Branch:** Uzunjati  
**Notable Skills:** Deception, Medicine, Performance, Religion  
**Hobbies:** dance, high fashion, kite-flying, watching motes of dust float through the air

#### Description
Noxolo fled from her home to escape her overbearing family, who had planned out every aspect of her life. Whispers from dead birds and cow bones told her she could find freedom at the Magaambya, and so she went, not knowing what to expect. What she discovered was a far bigger world than she'd ever dreamt possible, and a chance to unravel the mysteries of the strange whispers she hears.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** pausing to dance and sing about what she's doing when excited
**Strangest Quirk:** always uses murder in her hypothetical examples
**Common Associates:** Anchor Root (scavenging bones), Ignaci and Tzeniwe (discussing fashion)

#### Key Character Traits
**Dreamy • Spiritual • Eccentric • Artistic • Morbid**

#### Things Noxolo Might Say
- *"The bones whisper that you should... oh!"* (suddenly breaks into a little dance) *"♪ Take the path that winds around the garden, where the spirits like to play! ♪"*
- *"It's like when you're planning a murder— I mean, a surprise party! You have to consider all the angles and make sure no one sees you coming."*
- *"My snabble says you have interesting dreams. Don't worry, she only bites people who lie about their nightmares."* (pets her mysterious creature)

**Speech Mannerism:** Often starts sentences with "The bones/spirits say..." and breaks into spontaneous song or dance, plus uses unsettling metaphors involving death or violence for everyday situations.

**Physical Mannerism:** Traces patterns in the air with her finger while listening to spiritual voices or when deep in thought.

#### Role & Abilities
Though highly prone to spacing out during lectures, Noxolo does her best not to take her acceptance at the Magaambya for granted. The transition has been rougher on her than she likes to admit, however, and she often finds herself wracked with homesickness and guilt for leaving the family who cared enough about her to plan her life in such detail.

Noxolo dressed as a man to avoid being tracked down while traveling, noticing that many overlooked someone who appeared to be a man if they were searching for a woman. By the time she reached the Magaambya, Noxolo found she preferred her new look and has begun to experiment with various fashions and hairstyles.

Noxolo is accompanied at all times by a bizarre, 2-foot-long pet she refers to as her "snabble," a creature that resembles a fuzzy cross between a crocodile and a bear cub. The creature has attracted more than its fair share of curious scholars, though Noxolo herself seems uninterested in what sort of creature it truly is or where it originally came from.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A hollow bone bead with tiny dancing figures inside and holes that create melodies in the wind.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Noxolo will create custom clothing and accessories that enhance your personal style
- +1 to Study rolls for Uzunjati branch subjects (stacks with other Uzunjati friends)

**Topics Noxolo Can Help With:**
- Bone reading and divination techniques
- Traditional dances and cultural performances
- Fashion and personal style advice
- Spiritual communication and augury
- Uzunjati artistic expression methods
- Dealing with overbearing family expectations

### Okoro Obiyo (Uzunjati)
**NG | male | human | researcher**

**Branch:** Uzunjati  
**Notable Skills:** Athletics, Diplomacy, Performance, Occultism  
**Hobbies:** sports, board games, card games, deep research dives into random topics

#### Description
A bright-eyed and excitable Bonuwat youth from Senghor, Okoro's love of eclectic research got him shipped off to the Magaambya to hone his talents and, some joke, to spare everyone else in Senghor from his enthusiasm. To Okoro, whatever has caught his interest for the month is the most exciting thing ever, and nothing can pry his attention and passion away from it.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** preparing an 8-hour presentation on a completely different topic than the teacher assigned
**Strangest Quirk:** is scared of butterflies
**Common Associates:** Chizire and Mariama (gaming group), Esi (exercise partner), Ignaci (talking him into bad decisions)

#### Key Character Traits
**Enthusiastic • Curious • Distractible • Intelligent • Obsessive**

#### Things Okoro Obiyo Might Say
- *"Oh! That's fascinating! Did you know that the mating habits of Mwangi tree frogs actually relate to the economic policies of ancient Osirion? I spent all last week researching it!"*
- *"Wait, wait, WAIT! Before we do anything else, you absolutely HAVE to see this new board game I found. The rules are incredibly complex, but I think I've figured out the secret pattern!"*
- *"I would love to help you with that, but first— oh no, is that a butterfly? Where? GET IT AWAY FROM ME!"* (hides behind the nearest person)

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks in excited bursts with frequent tangents, often connecting unrelated topics, and gets visibly distressed by butterflies while being fearless about everything else.

**Physical Mannerism:** Taps his fingers rapidly on surfaces when thinking or excited, creating complex rhythmic patterns.

#### Role & Abilities
The self-directed nature of the Magaambya's classes has allowed him to pursue these interests more often than a typical university, though this sometimes gets him into trouble when he gets so absorbed in his current passion that he forgets about his other responsibilities.

Okoro hosts a biweekly game night that has become quite popular among the students. The games he organizes, often compete for favors, magical formulas, or campus secrets, making these events both entertaining and potentially quite valuable for ambitious students.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** A polished wooden bead carved like a tiny library with miniature books visible through crystal windows.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Okoro will research any topic for you and invite you to his exclusive game nights
- +1 to Study rolls for Uzunjati branch subjects (stacks with other Uzunjati friends)

**Topics Okoro Can Help With:**
- Any academic subject (current obsession changes monthly)
- Campus game nights and social events
- Athletic training and exercise routines
- Bonuwat culture and Senghor customs
- Research methodology and study techniques
- Uzunjati performance and storytelling arts

### Strands-of-Glowing-Dawn Tzeniwe (Emerald Bough)
**NG | female | anadi | dreamweaver**

**Branch:** Emerald Boughs  
**Notable Skills:** Crafting, Diplomacy, Performance, Society  
**Hobbies:** bird-watching, baking, high fashion

#### Description
A middle-aged woman who stands out among her younger peers, Tzeniwe sought the Magaambya later in life to gain an advanced education in the hopes of passing that education down to her children. A shy and awkward person from the nation of Nurvatcha, Tzeniwe knows that many in the Mwangi Expanse mistakenly believe shapeshifting anadis to be humans who turn into hideous spider creatures at night.

#### Personality
**Most Well Known For:** having elaborate themed outfits for every class
**Strangest Quirk:** leaving hidden anonymous gifts for people
**Common Associates:** Anchor Root (stress baking), Esi (babysitting), Ignaci and Noxolo (weaving cloth and sewing clothing)

#### Key Character Traits
**Nurturing • Anxious • Generous • Artistic • Maternal**

#### Things Tzeniwe Might Say
- *"Oh dear, you look tired. Here, I brought some fresh-baked honey cakes. And this scarf— I made it last night when I couldn't sleep. The colors reminded me of you."*
- *"Zachva! Zanvi! Get down from there this instant! I'm so sorry, they're usually better behaved than this. Well, actually, no they're not, but I keep hoping..."*
- *"I've been working on this tapestry that tells the story of... oh, excuse me, I need to catch my daughter before she climbs into that professor's bag."* (shoots out web to gently retrieve child)

**Speech Mannerism:** Speaks in a soft, caring tone but frequently gets interrupted by her children's antics, often multitasking conversation with parenting duties.

**Physical Mannerism:** Smooths down her clothing or adjusts her hair when anxious, and constantly keeps one eye on her children's location.

#### Role & Abilities
Though the Magaambya possesses a much more enlightened view on anadis, Tzeniwe is still painfully aware that many humanoids are terrified of spiders. Indeed, she's more forgiving of repulsed reactions than her friends think she should be. Possessing a cooperative and generous nature, Tzeniwe often leaves her peers small gifts to make them comfortable, such as cups of chilled tea, delicious snacks, or even soft scarves and kaftans.

Despite her introversion, Tzeniwe's two toddlers constantly pull her out of her shell. Named Zachva and Zanvi, the rambunctious pair have no qualms about jumping around in spider form, pestering other students, or climbing into places they shouldn't. Academy students have become impressed with Tzeniwe's ability to lasso her children from over 50 paces to retrieve them. Though Tzeniwe usually carries them with her during classes, a large spiderling on her back and a human child on one knee, she often asks others to watch them when the twins refuse to behave.

#### Friendship Bead
**Design:** An intricately woven silk bead in dozens of colors, creating a miniature tapestry of family scenes.

**Friendship Benefits:**
- Expert with anything having to do with children
- +1 to Study rolls for Emerald Bough branch subjects (stacks with other Emerald Bough friends)

**Topics Tzeniwe Can Help With:**
- Textile crafting and silk weaving
- Anadi culture and shapeshifting techniques
- Childcare and family management
- Patient teaching and learning methods
- Emerald Bough diplomatic arts
- Fashion design and clothing creation

## Teachers and Faculty

### Teacher Takulu Ot (Cascade Bearer - Mathematician)
**Kindly male human mathematician**

#### Description
If kindness and gentle guidance were a person, it'd be Takulu Ot. A human man with colorful clothing and warm eyes, he's well known for his heartwarming stories about his wife and endearing passion for anteaters. Takulu is the type of teacher we all wish we had - he'll often be found in Spire Dormitory checking up on his pupils and getting to know them on a personal level.

#### Teaching Style & Research
Among the topics he researches and teaches are mathematics, with particular focus on fractal geometry, and pedagogy. He asks students to think metacognitively about how they learn, what it means to know something, and generally challenges the way students think about things. His lessons end up feeling therapeutic in nature and have philosophical life lessons woven into them in such a way that students will think about them for several days.

#### Role in the Academy
As one of the primary instructors for new initiates, Teacher Ot handles admissions interviews, orientation, and major ceremonies. He's a recurring friend that students can go to for help, guidance, and all-around support. He emphasizes that "the price of magic is the responsibility to better the world."

---

### Teacher Lesedi (Cascade Bearer - Extraplanar Scholar)
**Intimidating female Alijae elf extraplanar scholar**

#### Description
An Alijae elf, Lesedi is an intimidating figure despite her small stature. Coming from a culture that formed around fighting demons and other extraplanar threats, she does not accept even the smallest mistakes as they can be lethal when dealing with fiends. To add to her downright terrifying persona, she seems to have a supernatural sense for what students are doing and the pranks they are planning, giving her an ominous almost-prescient air that's sure to leave some students seriously disconcerted.

However, despite her outward appearance and demon-bone accessories, Lesedi is best described as sweet and kind. She's quick to offer praise moments after eviscerating a student for mispronouncing an incantation.

#### Research & Expertise
Lesedi researches all things extraplanar. If anyone wants to travel beyond the Material Plane, she's the leading expert to talk to. She has information not just on how to get there, but how to handle the denizens, what to expect, and all around how to survive. Lesedi does not just study the fiendish end of extraplanars but is more than knowledgeable on celestials, monitors, and all sorts of outsiders.

Even more than that, she's researching into interstellar expeditions. She was alive for the launch of Lirgen's Glory and is still upset from the tragedy.

---

### Teacher Zuma (Emerald Bough - Conspiracy Theorist)
**CN male half-orc conspiracy theorist**

#### Description
Zuma is a very eccentric fellow interested in devils and their infiltration into Golarion's governments. However, his study devolves into conspiracy more times than not as he tends to see the machinations of such beings everywhere. He is certainly the professor students look to if they have questions about topics no one else can answer, but he's an unreliable source.

Due to the gravity of the ideas he comes up with, Zuma tends to be overzealous and "passionate" about sharing his conspiracy theories and attempts to involve his students and colleagues in his ramblings.

#### Teaching Style & Expertise
Zuma's study into devil-worshipping cults and conspiracies has made him paranoid. As such, his lessons are rambling discussions on how to best protect oneself. However, he is not proposing tinfoil hats, or at least he doesn't stop there. Zuma is an expert in abjuration and defensive magics. He knows how to prevent charm effects, recover lost knowledge, fend off scrying, and more. Due to the copious threats that use beguiling and manipulative magics, Zuma's knowledge is not to be overlooked.

His classes range from details of eminently useful rituals to utterly nonsensical ramblings, often within the space of only a few minutes.

---

### Teacher Koride Ulawa (Rain-Scribe - Naturalist)
**CN female human naturalist**

#### Description
At her worst, Koride is lazy, biting, and cruel. She's quick to respond to perceived slights with quips of her own but slow to attend to her own classes. Her punishments towards students are excessive, embarrassing, and devoid of kindness, but her approach to her own mistakes is forgiving and forgetful.

However, Koride is not uniquely villainous. She's a very fun teacher who's happy to tell jokes and share in pranks. Furthermore, she's genuinely passionate about bugs and the field of entomology, often keeping many as pets.

#### Teaching Style & Research
Koride is well-known for her lackadaisical approach to teaching. However, she does enjoy teaching about bugs and seems to have a particular interest in detritovores. She feels such bugs are underappreciated by many cultures who fail to see the value and necessity of such animals in the web of life. Her favorite research areas are the parts of nature that many people find repulsive: fungus, decay, and insects. She's the Magaambya's most skilled entomologist in generations.

---

### Teacher Izem Mezitani (Rain-Scribe - Archaeologist)
**Winged aasimar human archaeologist**

#### Description
Izem is more adventurer than professor. Being an aasimar, he is intelligent to an almost inhuman degree, having several doctorates in several nations. However, he is not usually present at the Magaambya for long, spending most of his time on expeditions and archaeological recoveries. Unlike many other professors, Izem likely has hands-on experience with fighting fiends and other threats to humanity. He's not a retired adventurer that settled down, he is an active adventurer who is likely working on some major quest or recovering from his last one.

#### Personal Details
He has a major crush on Tahenkot and is uncharacteristically anxious around her. This small detail juxtaposes very nicely with his otherwise demigod-like capability.

#### Teaching Style
Izem's expertise is so incredibly broad that he makes a great teacher for information that can't fit elsewhere. His lectures would be of particular use as they often include first-hand recounts of his escapades. However, he might not be the best professor from an academic standpoint as his lectures would often be derailed by these lengthy stories.

### Teacher Mafika Ayuwari (Tempest-Sun Mage - Martial Artist)
**NG male human martial artist**

#### Description
Mafika is a bit like Kronk from The Emperor's New Groove - he's focused on his physical and mental well-being and is an incredible athlete who is likely working out constantly. One of the most famous teachers currently on campus, he recently returned from Tian Xia, where his team fought in the fabled Ruby Phoenix Tournament.

#### Teaching Philosophy & Care
Mafika encourages his students to take care of themselves, but not in a toxic gym-rat manner, but more of a gym-bro style. He's concerned when students skip meals and don't sleep well, taking issue with a lot of the stereotypical college student lifestyle. Ever the caring instructor, Mafika is likely to provide healthy food, notably noodles and soup, to his classes and include tips on how to stay fit.

#### Expertise & Classes
Mafika's line of expertise is simply martial arts. His magic pertains towards combat and involves a lot of sparring matches. If the school has any major sports, Mafika is surely involved and shamelessly promoting student engagement. This includes non-competitive sports such as rock-climbing, various forms of boating and swimming, dancing, and more. However, his lectures are interrupted in a similar manner to other adventuring professors by anecdotes of his latest escapades.

### Teacher Tahenkot (Tempest-Sun Mage - Scholar)
**Demanding female human scholar**

#### Description
Tahenkot is the stereotypical strict teacher. She's harsh and is not afraid to share her criticisms of students. However, she is not mean in her intentions, she just has high expectations. Tahenkot wants her students to be putting their best effort towards learning because she certainly is. While her tactics may be brutal, if the moment arises for genuine compliments and praise, Tahenkot is unparalleled in her effect and her approval may mean a lot to students who want to impress her.

#### Teaching Style
Tahenkot's lectures do not have a singular topic that relates them all. Instead, the main thing to focus on is the difficulty. She makes classes with copious homework and covers exceedingly high-level material. However, Tahenkot does take interest in history and flight magic. Regardless of the topic, her lectures often task students to question the validity of information being presented as factual and to think critically about topics before making conclusions.

#### Student Relations
Meetings with her will involve some amounts of criticism, but she directs her fury mainly onto students like Haibram, Chizire, and Mariama rather than more sensitive students. Her high standards mean that when she does give genuine compliments, they carry significant weight.

### Teacher Ahassunu (Uzunjati - Historian)
**Absentminded female iruxi historian**

#### Description
Ahassunu is characterized by her absent-mindedness and repeated disappearances. Unlike Koride, whose laid-back attitude is attributed to laziness, Ahassunu is a lizardfolk who is so constantly engrossed in thought that she sometimes forgets her duties. In writing papers and researching history, time will slip by her without notice until several hours have passed and she's forgotten all commitments.

However, she's not absent-minded by any means and, in stark contrast, is very easily able to remember the history of the Mwangi Expanse in excruciatingly great detail. When she is able to discuss her favorite topics, she does so with gusto and infectious enthusiasm.

#### Teaching & Research
Ahassunu is deeply interested in the history of other cultures. Her lectures would involve long discussions on the developments of various nations, cities, and peoples in the Mwangi Expanse and beyond. As such, this lizardfolk is likely incredibly multilingual and, if any students are in one of her language classes, will exclusively speak to them in that language. She will also be able to greet and converse with students in their first languages with the efficacy of a native speaker.

### Teacher Nhyira (Uzunjati - Playwright)
**Genderfluid elf playwright and writer**

#### Description
Nhyira is well known as the Magaambya's main playwright and writer. She's perhaps the most literarily inclined professor at the school and is often found partaking in Nantambu's theaters as both audience member, actor, and director. In addition, she's known for being biting towards students she feels are slacking, preferring sarcastic retorts rather than outright shouting.

#### Teaching Style
Nhyira, being a playwright and writer, writes her lectures to feel like mini-plays. She wants her students to experience history and as such makes them reenact crucial sieges, forbidden love between nobles, and monumental political speeches. Her classes tend to employ lots of writing assignments and really focus on blurring the line between literature and history.

#### Student Relations
If there are any bards in the group, she's by far the best person to get inspiration from and talk to about their next performance. She has high standards and isn't afraid to use wit and sarcasm to motivate underperforming students.

**Note:** Nhyira is genderfluid and will express herself differently over the course of the adventure.

### Teacher Janatimo (Uzunjati - Branch Head)
**Itinerant male half-elf storyteller**

#### Description
Janatimo is the current head of the Uzunjati branch and as such is a manifestation of their ideals. He's very kind and often keen to hear stories that students have and come up with. He's a listener, not a speaker, but can certainly spin a tale when necessary.

#### Teaching Philosophy
Janatimo has a way of making students question what they hear and how they hear it, encouraging everyone to dig deeper into the stories they hear. As the branch head, he embodies the Uzunjati focus on expression through art and storytelling, as well as philosophical questions about how language affects thought and how the telling of history changes over time and across cultures.

## Other Staff Members

### Lumusi Yao (Head Cook)
**NG female human chef**

Lumusi Yao is a kindly chef who cares about the health of the Magaambya. She makes a point of coming out to greet new students and welcoming them to the dining hall, which she considers her domain. She notes that students receive two meals every day and that the dining hall is open from sunrise until two hours after sunset. She is nearly constantly cooking, as she does have to feed the whole school, and is rarely seen away from the kitchen.

### Xhokan (Quartermaster)
**Meticulous quartermaster**

Xhokan is incredibly organized and meticulous. He knows everything coming into his store and going out. He'll have records about where it came from, how long he's had it, what quality it is, any and all hazards related to it, and all around too much information for most students. As the academy's quartermaster, he manages supplies and equipment for students and faculty.

### Thema (Senior Landscaper)
**CG female elf gardener**

Thema is the most senior landscaper in the Magaambya. She likely takes care of the leshy gardens and shifting greenhouse. As the chief groundskeeper, she manages the academy's extensive gardens and green spaces, including the specialized areas where magical plants and leshys reside. She discourages the leshys from ranging far from their patch of overgrown land because they have a tendency to cause mischief.

### High-Sun Mage Oyamba (Academy Leader)
**Academy Leader**

High-Sun Mage Oyamba is the Magaambya's current leader. What characterization is available suggests he's graceful and charismatic, befitting his position as head of the world's oldest magical academy. While he plays a significant role in later books, he is never given too much screen time and serves largely as a quest-giver during the early adventures.

## Branch Information

### Rain-Scribes
The Rain-Scribes are described as the branch of adaptability, focusing on the natural world and survivalism. Their magic would likely derive heavily from the primal tradition and focus largely on adapting, like many animals, to one's environment.

### Cascade Bearers
Cascade Bearers esteem imagination above all else. These are the pioneers of the Magaambya world and work often in developing burgeoning fields. Their research and lectures consist of blending magic in new mannerisms, spell creation, and innovating fields that have not been previously explored.

### Tempest-Sun Mages
Protectors of Nantambu and defenders of valor, the Tempest-Sun Mages are as close as you can get to superheroes. This branch is the most overt in fighting evil and are a perfect fit for more martially focused characters.

### Emerald Boughs
The Emerald Boughs branch is a branch of social sciences and cultural study. They're the branch of diplomats, politicians, and community leaders. Many lectures discuss different cultural approaches to magic and the enchantment school.

### Uzunjati
The Uzunjati branch is the most artistic branch of scholarship in the Magaambya. It's the branch of playwrights, writers, and artists, but also one of historians and diplomats. At its most basic, the Uzunjati deal with expression of oneself through art and storytelling. However, this branch also asks more philosophical questions such as "How does our language affect our thoughts?" and "How does the way we tell history change over time and across cultures?"
