She's harsh and is not afraid to share her criticisms of students. However, she is not mean in her intentions, she just has high expectations. Tahenkot wants her students to be putting their best effort towards learning because she certainly is. While her tactics may be brutal, if the moment arises for genuine compliments and praise, Tahenkot is unparalleled in her effect and her approval may mean a lot to students who want to impress her.</p><h3>Teaching Style</h3><p>Tahenkot's lectures do not have a singular topic that relates them all. Instead, the main thing to focus on is the difficulty. She makes classes with copious homework and covers exceedingly high-level material. However, Tahenkot does take interest in history and flight magic. Regardless of the topic, her lectures often task students to question the validity of information being presented as factual and to think critically about topics before making conclusions.</p><h3>Student Relations</h3><p>Meetings with her will involve some amounts of criticism, but she directs her fury mainly onto students like Haibram, Chizire, and Mariama rather than more sensitive students.
