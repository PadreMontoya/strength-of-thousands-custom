She hails from the small Redridge clan, several weeks' travel south-west from the Magaambya. Her clan has been in decline for several decades, with important storytellers and religious leaders dying before suitable replacements could be trained. Anchor Root is the only child in the clan with the potential talent to replace Redridge's aging bonekeeper.</p><p>Anchor Root's entire family has placed their hopes on the young gnoll—unfortunately, Anchor Root's temperament is ill-suited to such pressure. Though she has always had issues with anxiety, the expectations currently placed on her shoulders have left her in a constant state of panic. The slightest flaw in her work or actions, whether real or perceived, can leave Anchor Root a devastated wreck for days.</p><h3>Personality</h3><p><strong>Most Well Known For:</strong> interrupting herself halfway through a presentation to exclaim \"I'm sorry, I'm boring you\" and running out of the room crying<br><strong>Strangest Quirk:</strong> uses a chicken tied to a stick to keep her room free of unwanted bugs<br><strong>Common Associates:</strong> Esi (working on music playback magic), Noxolo (scavenging bones), Tzeniwe (stress baking)</p><div data-visibility=\"gm\"><h4>Key Character Traits</h4><p><strong>Shy • Hesitant • Apologetic • Lacks Confidence • Introvert</strong></p><h4>Things Anchor Root Might Say</h4><ul><li><em>\"Oh!

She is always on the lookout for the bones of worthy creatures—gnolls or otherwise—that can be symbolically adopted by her troubled clan to serve as spiritual mentors and protectors. The gnoll also has a hobby of anonymously recording music played around the city and then working with other students to play back the music on campus for others to hear.</p></div><p><strong>Friendship Bead:</strong> @UUID[Item.BeadFromAnchorRoot001]{Bead from Anchor Root}</p>"},"video":{},"src":null,"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"name":"Chizire (Cascade Bearer)","type":"text","_id":"Chizire001","title":{"show":true,"level":2},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p><strong>CN | male | catfolk | alchemist</strong></p><p><strong>Branch:</strong> Cascade Bearers<br><strong>Notable Skills:</strong> Crafting, Medicine, Stealth, Thievery<br><strong>Hobbies:</strong> brewing, mechanical engineering, moonshine distillation</p><h3>Description</h3><p>Chizire is a laid-back catfolk who seems to effortlessly excel at everything he attempts, much to the frustration of his more studious peers.
