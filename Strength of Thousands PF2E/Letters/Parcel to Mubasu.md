# Parcel to Mubasu

**To:** Mubasu  
**Address:** You know Mubasu, his mother's Inyene from Abwele, but he's from the city, grew up in Ejosa, and moved when he got married. Lives with his in-laws now, has many children and seven dogs and an ostrich and four cats which I told him will steal his baby's breath, but he won't listen. He has a shrine to Gozreh in front of his house.

Dear Mubasu,

I hope this finds you well and that your menagerie hasn't grown since I last wrote! I'm still amazed at how you manage to keep track of seven dogs, four cats, an ostrich, AND all those children. Your wife truly is a saint.

Inside this parcel you'll find the medicine for your youngest daughter's cough, as well as the special feed for your ostrich that the animal handler in Nantambu recommended. He says it should help with the bird's digestion problems - apparently ostriches are more delicate than they look!

I've also included some of the cat deterrent herbs we discussed. I know you don't believe the old wives' tales about cats stealing babies' breath, but humor an old friend and at least keep them out of the nursery, won't you? Better safe than sorry.

The children's toys are at the bottom of the parcel - wooden animals carved by the same craftsman who made that beautiful shrine to Gozreh you have in your front yard. I thought the little ones might enjoy them.

Give my love to your wife and tell her I still think she deserves a medal for putting up with your zoo!

Your concerned friend,  
Auntie Nkem
