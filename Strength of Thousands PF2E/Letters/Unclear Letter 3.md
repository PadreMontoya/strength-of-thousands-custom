My dear friend,

I hope this letter finds you in good health. I wanted to thank you again for the wonderful advice about treating fever in children. Your grandmother's remedy worked perfectly when little Kemi fell ill last month.

The herbs you recommended are growing well in my garden now. I've been sharing them with other mothers in the village, and everyone speaks highly of their effectiveness. You truly have a gift for healing.

I'm writing to ask if you might have time to visit next month. My sister is expecting her first child, and she's quite nervous about the birth. Having someone with your knowledge and calm presence would be such a comfort to her.

Of course, I understand if you're too busy with your own family and patients. But if you can manage it, we would be so grateful.

I've enclosed some of the honey from our hives as a small token of appreciation.

With love and respect,  
Amina
