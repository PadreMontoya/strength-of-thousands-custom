Cousin,

The fishing has been excellent this season! The new nets you suggested have made all the difference. We're catching twice as many fish as last year, and the quality is much better too.

I wanted to let you know that I've set aside some of the best catch for you - the large river fish you're so fond of. They're preserved and ready for transport whenever you can arrange to collect them.

Also, young Taiwo has been asking about learning the boat-building techniques you showed him last summer. If you have time during your next visit, he'd be thrilled to continue his lessons. The boy has real talent with his hands.

The whole family sends their greetings. We're all looking forward to seeing you at the next festival.

Your cousin,  
Olumide
