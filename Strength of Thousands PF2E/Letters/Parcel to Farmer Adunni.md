# Parcel to Farmer Adunni

**To:** Farmer Adunni  
**Address:** The woman with the red roof who keeps goats, three hills past where the old bridge used to be, near the grove where the monkeys chatter loudest at dawn

Dear Adunni,

I hope your goats are thriving and that the new kids are growing strong! I heard from a traveling merchant that you had twins born last month - what a blessing.

This parcel contains the goat medicine you requested, along with the special mineral supplements the animal healer in the city recommended. He says they'll help prevent the hoof problems that have been affecting livestock in the region this season.

I've also included some of the hardy vegetable seeds you wanted to try in your garden. The merchant who sold them to me swears they'll grow in almost any soil and produce vegetables that store well through the dry season. Perfect for someone as practical as you!

There's a small bag of the spiced salt mix at the bottom - it's wonderful for preserving meat and cheese. I thought you might find it useful for your goat products.

The payment you sent was more than enough to cover everything, so I've included a little extra - some of the fine thread you admired at the market. I know how much you enjoy embroidery work during the quiet evening hours.

May your herds multiply and your gardens flourish!

With warm regards,  
Trader Folake
