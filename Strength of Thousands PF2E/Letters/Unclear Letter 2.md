Brother,

The rains have been good to us this season. The yam harvest exceeded all expectations, and we have enough to trade for the tools we need for next year's planting.

Mother asks when you're coming to visit. She's been saving the best palm wine for your arrival, and you know how impatient she gets when her wine sits too long! Father's health is much improved since the dry season ended.

I've sent a portion of the harvest with this letter - enough to keep your family fed for several weeks. The children must be growing fast; I remember how much you could eat at their age!

Give my love to your wife and tell the little ones their uncle has stories waiting for them.

Your brother,  
Chidi
