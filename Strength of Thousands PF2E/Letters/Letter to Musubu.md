My dear friend Musubu,

I heard the most delightful story from your neighbor Mama Kesi about your latest rescue! A puppy stuck up a tree - now that's something you don't hear every day. She said you climbed up there yourself, despite your wife's protests about your creaking knees, and came down with the little fellow tucked safely in your shirt.

I'm not surprised, of course. You've always had a soft spot for creatures in need, ever since we were children and you insisted on bringing home every stray cat in the village. Your wife is a saint for putting up with your menagerie all these years!

I'm writing to let you know that my cousin's dog had puppies last month, and she's looking for good homes for them. I immediately thought of you - not because you need another mouth to feed, but because I know you'd give one of them the loving home they deserve. They're a mix of hunting dog and something else (possibly goat, judging by their climbing abilities), and they're already showing signs of being quite clever.

If you're interested, or if you know anyone else who might be, please let me know. Otherwise, I'll just have to keep visiting them myself, and my own wife is starting to give me the same look yours gives you when you bring home strays!

Your old friend,  
Babatunde
