Dearest Chinasa,

I hope this letter finds you well and that your fingers haven't been pricked too many times by your needles! I heard through the market gossip that little Amara is finally getting married next month. What wonderful news!

I remember when she was just a tiny thing, always getting into your fabric scraps and making "dresses" for her dolls. Now she's going to be a bride! Time truly does fly like a startled parrot.

I'm writing to ask if you might have any of that beautiful golden thread left from the ceremonial robes you made for the harvest festival. I know it's precious, but I'm working on something special for my own daughter's coming-of-age ceremony, and nothing would honor the occasion quite like thread that has been blessed by such skilled hands as yours.

Of course, I'm happy to trade for it - I have some lovely indigo dye that came in fresh from the coast, and you know how well it takes to cotton.

Give my love to your family, and congratulations again on the upcoming wedding!

With warm regards,  
Folake
