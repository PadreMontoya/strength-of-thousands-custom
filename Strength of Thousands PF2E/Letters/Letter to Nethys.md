All-Seeing Nethys, Guardian of the Magical Arts,

I write to you as a humble student of the arcane, seeking your blessing and guidance in my studies. Magic flows through all things, as you have taught us, but I struggle to understand its deeper mysteries.

I have been practicing the fundamental cantrips for months now, but my progress feels slow and uncertain. My light spells flicker when they should shine steadily, my mage hand wavers when it should be firm, and my prestidigitation effects are unpredictable at best. I fear I may not have the natural talent required for the magical arts.

Yet I feel drawn to magic with every fiber of my being. When I see a skilled wizard weave spells with graceful precision, my heart soars. When I read about the great magical discoveries of the past, I dream of contributing my own small part to that grand tradition. When I hold a spell component in my hand, I can almost feel the potential energy waiting to be shaped and directed.

I ask for your divine insight: Am I meant to walk the path of magic, or should I turn my efforts elsewhere? If I am meant to continue, please grant me the patience to persevere through these early struggles and the wisdom to learn from my mistakes.

I offer this letter to your divine power, to be transformed or destroyed as you see fit. Let the very act of its magical delivery be a lesson in the nature of arcane forces.

Your devoted student,  
Apprentice Kemi
