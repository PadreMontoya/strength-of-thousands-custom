# Parcel to Fisherman Kemi

**To:** Fisherman Kemi  
**Address:** The man who lives in the house with blue shutters by the bend in the river where the herons nest, downstream from the village but upstream from the rapids

Dear Kemi,

I hope the fishing has been good and that the herons haven't been stealing too much of your catch! I always enjoy watching them when I pass by your place - they're such graceful birds, even when they're being thieves.

This parcel contains the new fishing nets you ordered, woven by the best net-makers in the coastal villages. They used the special knots you requested - the ones that are supposed to be stronger but still allow smaller fish to escape. The fishermen there say these nets have brought them great success.

I've also included the waterproof coating you wanted for your boat. The instructions are written on the small scroll inside - apparently you need to apply it during the dry season for best results, so you might want to wait a few months.

There's a surprise in there too - some of the smoked fish seasoning that's become so popular in the city markets. I thought you might enjoy trying it, and if you like it, I can bring more on my next trip.

The river spirits have been kind to you, my friend. Your reputation as a skilled fisherman has spread all the way to Nantambu! Several merchants have asked me if I know anyone who can provide regular shipments of quality fish.

Tight lines and calm waters,  
River Trader Olu
