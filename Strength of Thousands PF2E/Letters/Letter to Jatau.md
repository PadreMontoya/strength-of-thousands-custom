Dear Jatau,

I hope your fruit trees are recovering well from the recent storms. I heard from the market vendors that you lost some branches but that the main trunks are all intact - what a relief!

I'm writing with a rather unusual request. My daughter is getting married in two months, and I'm planning the wedding feast. I remember the incredible mango jam you brought to the harvest festival last year - it was absolutely divine! Several people asked me for the recipe, but of course I had to tell them it was your family secret.

Would you be willing to make a few jars for the wedding? I know it's a lot to ask, especially with your trees still recovering, but I'd be happy to pay whatever you think is fair. The wedding will have guests from three different villages, and I'd love to serve them something truly special that represents the best of our local craftsmanship.

If you can't manage it, I completely understand. But if you can, you'd be helping to make my daughter's day even more memorable.

I've enclosed a small token of appreciation for even considering my request - some of the honey cakes my wife is famous for. I hope you enjoy them with your evening tea.

With gratitude and respect,  
Chinedu
