# Unclear Letter 1 - Illegible Address

**To:** [Illegible scrawl - possibly "Adaora" or "Adora"?]  
**Address:** [Completely illegible handwriting - looks like "...something Street" or "...Lane"?]

Dear [illegible name],

Thank you for your letter about the fabric order. I have the blue cotton you requested, and the pattern is coming along nicely. The embroidery work is more intricate than I initially thought, but I believe you'll be pleased with the results.

I should have everything ready by the end of next week. The colors are exactly as you specified - deep blue like the evening sky, with silver thread for the star patterns.

I've also included a small sample of the new silk that arrived from the eastern traders. If you like it, I can incorporate it into the border design for a small additional cost.

Please let me know if you need any changes to the original design.

Best regards,  
Seamstress Yemi
