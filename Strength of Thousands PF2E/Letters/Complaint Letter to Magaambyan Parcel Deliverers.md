# Complaint Letter to Magaambyan Parcel Deliverers

**To:** Magaambyan Parcel Deliverers  
**Address:** Magaambya Academy, Nantambu  

---

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to express my extreme displeasure with the incompetence displayed by your delivery service three weeks ago. A parcel intended for my granddaughter Ndidi was misdelivered to the wrong house on the same street, and it has taken me this long to discover what happened to it!

The parcel contained precious family heirlooms - my grandmother's silver bracelets and the ceremonial cloth that has been passed down through four generations of women in our family. These items were meant to be given to Ndidi for her coming-of-age ceremony, which has now passed without this important tradition being observed.

When the parcel didn't arrive, I assumed it had been lost or stolen. I spent weeks making inquiries and even considered reporting the matter to the local authorities. It was only by chance that I learned from a neighbor that someone else on our street had received a package they weren't expecting.

This is not just a simple mistake - this is a failure to honor the sacred trust placed in your institution. The Magaambya is supposed to represent wisdom, responsibility, and service to the community. How can you claim to serve the people when you cannot even deliver a simple parcel to the correct address?

I demand that this matter be resolved immediately. The woman who received my granddaughter's parcel (one Jatia, who lives at the wrong end of our street) is now claiming that since she has had the items for weeks, they belong to her! This is preposterous, but she refuses to return them without some sort of official intervention.

I expect your students to personally resolve this situation and ensure that my granddaughter receives what is rightfully hers. If this matter is not handled promptly and professionally, I will be forced to take my complaint to the village elders and the academy administration.

The reputation of the Magaambya depends on the competence of its students. Do not let one careless mistake tarnish the good name of your institution.

I await your immediate response and action.

Most displeased,  
Grandmother Adaeze Okafor
