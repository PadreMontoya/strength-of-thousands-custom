**Delivery Instructions:** Attach to a kite, fly high in the air, then cut free

Great Gozreh, Master of Wind and Wave,

I write to you from beneath the storm clouds that have blessed our lands with much-needed rain. Your winds have carried the moisture from distant seas to nourish our crops and fill our rivers. For this, I am deeply grateful.

But I come to you now with a humble request. My youngest son, Emeka, has always been fascinated by the sky and the patterns of weather. He can predict rain by the way the birds fly and knows when storms are coming by the smell of the wind. I believe he has been touched by your divine influence.

He dreams of becoming a weather-reader, one who can help farmers know when to plant and fishermen know when to stay ashore. But he is young and uncertain of his path. I ask that you send him a sign - perhaps through the flight of this very letter - that his calling is true and that you will guide his studies.

If this letter reaches you successfully, carried by your own winds to your celestial realm, please let the boy know through whatever means you deem appropriate. A favorable wind, a meaningful cloud formation, or even just the confidence to pursue his dreams would be blessing enough.

I release this letter to your care, trusting in your wisdom and benevolence.

Your humble servant,  
Chinedu the Farmer

*[Note: This letter must be attached to a kite and flown high before being cut free to "deliver" it to Gozreh]*
