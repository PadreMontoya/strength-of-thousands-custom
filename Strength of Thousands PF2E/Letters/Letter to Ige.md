# Letter to Ige

Dear Ige,

I hope this letter reaches you during one of your quieter moments, when the birds are resting and you have a chance to sit down with a cup of tea.

My nephew Kemi was telling me about the magnificent toucan you helped last month - the one with the injured wing that everyone thought would never fly again. He saw it soaring over the market just yesterday, as bright and bold as ever! Your gift with these creatures never ceases to amaze me.

I'm writing because I found something that might interest you. While cleaning out my late husband's study, I discovered his old journal from his days as a traveling merchant. It contains detailed notes about bird migration patterns he observed across the Mwangi Expanse, including sketches of several species I've never seen before. Some of the notes mention seasonal behaviors and nesting habits that might be useful for your rehabilitation work.

Would you like me to bring it by the sanctuary? I know how much you value any information that might help you better understand your feathered patients. Plus, I'd love to see how the new aviaries are coming along - Kemi says you've been building something special for the larger birds.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours in friendship,  
Adunni
