**ENCLOSED MESSAGE TO BE TRANSCRIBED:**

Blessed Mazludeh, Protector of Communities,

We humbly request your divine blessing upon the new canal wall being constructed in our village. This wall will protect our homes and fields from the seasonal floods that have plagued us for generations.

The entire community has worked together on this project - young and old, rich and poor, all contributing their labor and resources. It represents the best of what we can achieve when we unite for the common good.

We ask that you make this wall strong and reliable, able to withstand the mightiest floods and serve our community for generations to come. Let it stand as a symbol of our cooperation and your divine protection.

May the serpent that receives this message carry our prayers to your celestial realm.

The Village of Ikenna

**FULL LETTER:**

Blessed Mazludeh,

I serve as the village scribe and have been asked to send this prayer to you through the traditional means. Our community has come together to build a new canal wall, and we seek your blessing upon this important project.

The message above should be carefully transcribed onto a quail egg using the sacred inks, then offered to one of your serpent messengers. I have been told that the priests at your shrine in Nantambu can assist with this ritual.

We understand that if the snake refuses the egg, it indicates that our request is not favored. We pray that our community's sincere efforts and cooperative spirit will make our petition acceptable to you.

Your humble servant,  
Village Scribe Adaeze

*[Note: This letter requires transcribing the message onto an egg and feeding it to a snake at Mazludeh's shrine]*
