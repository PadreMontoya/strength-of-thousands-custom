Dear Chukwu,

I hope this parcel reaches you safely! Inside you'll find the tools you ordered from the city blacksmith - the new hoe heads and the set of carving knives you wanted for your woodworking.

The blacksmith says the metal is some of the finest he's worked with this year, imported from the mountain forges. The hoe heads should last you many seasons, and the carving knives are sharp enough to split a hair (though I don't recommend trying that - I nearly lost a finger testing them!).

I've also included a small surprise - some of that spiced honey you enjoyed so much when you visited the market last month. My wife insisted I send some along, saying anyone who works as hard as you do deserves a sweet treat now and then.

The total cost came to exactly what we discussed, so we're all settled up. I hope the tools serve you well in your work.

Give my regards to your family, and don't be a stranger - the market isn't the same without your stories and laughter.

Your friend,  
Merchant Kelechi
