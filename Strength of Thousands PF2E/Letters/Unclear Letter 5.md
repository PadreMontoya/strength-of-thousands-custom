Dear Teacher,

I hope you are well and that your students are behaving better than mine! I'm writing to share some exciting news about the literacy program we discussed.

The village council has approved funding for new writing materials, and we should have enough slate boards and chalk for all the children by next month. The parents are so excited - many of them never learned to read themselves and are thrilled their children will have this opportunity.

I was wondering if you might have any old teaching materials you could spare? Books, practice sheets, anything that might help us get started. I know it's a lot to ask, but any help would be greatly appreciated.

I've also been thinking about your suggestion to start with simple stories that the children already know. Do you have any recommendations for tales that work well for beginning readers?

Thank you for all your encouragement and advice. Having a mentor like you makes this endeavor feel much less daunting.

With gratitude,  
Teacher Adaeze
