E
ducation is far from easy at the oldest and most prestigious magic academy in the 
world! The newest students at the venerable Magaambya school of magic begin their 
academic careers with tests of skill and ingenuity. While all Magaambya students 
contend with the school’s rigorous course load, these heroes must also investigate the 
strange infestations and supernatural intruders lurking in the school’s ancient buildings. 
The Strength of Thousands Adventure Path begins with “Kindled Magic,” a complete 
adventure for 1st- to 3rd-level characters.
