Magic
As the oldest magical school in the Inner Sea region, 
the Magaambya boasts a wide collection of powerful 
items and unusual spells. Unlike many of its academic 
counterparts on the continent of Avistan, the 
Magaambya also offers a stipend to its students instead 
of requiring tuition fees. Even the newest Magaambyan 
initiate can usually afford to commission a magical 
item or purchase a spell that catches their interest. 
This support helps contribute to the 
Magaambya’s diversity of thought 
and allows it to remain at the 
forefront of magical research. 
The following new rules 
options are available to 
the heroes in their role as 
students of the Magaambya, 
including uncommon rules 
they might uncover by deepening 
their relationships with other 
students at the school.
Magical Masks
One of the benefits granted to full-fledged Attendants 
is the right to wear a Magaambyan mask, or to 
have their personal mask acknowledged by the 
Magaambya. Tradition dictates that these creations 
be carved into the shape of an animal. As a mage 
continues to wear the mask, the object gradually 
gains an “imprint” of its owner’s true spiritual face. In 
addition to forming their masks into familiars ( Lost 
Omens Character Guide  101), Magaambyans often 
place useful enchantments on their masks to aid them 
in their more dangerous ventures.
GOZ MASK ITEM 2+
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
Originally designed by a fanatical sect of Gozren priests, 
goz masks  were designed to help navigate the area 
around the Eye of Abendego. The masks couldn’t contend 
with the might of the storm, but they remain in use by 
people all around the Mwangi Expanse. These masks 
are typically made of wood and crafted to sport round, 
exaggerated features. 
Activate [one-action] Interact; Frequency 
once per day; Effect You ignore 
concealment caused by fog, smoke, 
and other obscuring vapors for 1 
minute. 
Type goz mask; Level 2; Price 30 gp
Type greater goz mask; Level 6; Price 
240 gp
The effect lasts for 10 minutes.
Type major goz mask ; Level 12; Price 
1,900 gp
The major goz mask  gives you darkvision and 
allows you to ignore all concealment from any 
environmental effects for 1 hour.
HERD MASK ITEM 6
UNCOMMON CONJURATION INVESTED MAGICAL TELEPORTATION
Price 210 gp
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
All herd masks are linked to at least one other herd mask 
and are usually sold in sets of multiple masks. Linked herd 
masks look similar to one another, with only the slightest 
of differences to tell them apart.
Activate [two-actions] envision; Frequency once per day; Effect You 
swap locations with another creature wearing a linked 
herd mask  within 100 feet. If you and the creature 
you swapped with are disguised as each other, other 
creatures gain an immediate Perception check against 
the lower of your or the other wearer’s Deception DCs to 
Impersonate each other. On a failure, they don’t realize 
the swap occurred. 
Craft Requirements  Supply a casting of dimension door . 
You can link a herd mask you create to another herd mask 
in your possession when you finish crafting it, which 
causes it to be linked to the chosen mask as well as all 
other herd masks that are also linked to the chosen mask.

MASK OF THE CURSED EYE  ITEM 8
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL NECROMANCY
Price 475 gp 
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
These masks are always decorated with at 
least one wide, staring eye. 
The first time each day a creature 
on your plane that you can’t 
perceive targets you with a 
divination spell, the creature must 
attempt a DC 24 Will save. This 
effect is automatic and does not 
require you to Activate the item.
Critical Success The creature is 
unaffected.
Success The creature is unaffected. 
You know you’ve been targeted 
with a divination spell, but the mask 
gives you no additional information. 
Failure The creature is sickened 1 and 
dazzled for 1 minute. You know you’ve 
been targeted with a divination spell, 
but the mask gives you no additional 
information.
Critical Failure The creature is sickened 2 and dazzled for 
10 minutes, and the spell is disrupted. You gain a brief 
mental glimpse of the triggering creature and learn its 
approximate distance and direction.
MASK OF MERCY  ITEM 4
UNCOMMON FORTUNE INVESTED MAGICAL NECROMANCY
Price 100 gp
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
This porcelain or alabaster mask portrays an angelic 
visage of kindness and mercy.
Activate [free-action] envision (fortune); Frequency once 
per day; Trigger You are about to roll a 
variable number of Hit Points you restore 
from an action with the healing 
trait; Effect Roll twice to 
determine the number of Hit 
Points you restore and take 
the higher result.
PSYCHOPOMP MASK  ITEM 1
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL NECROMANCY
Price 5 gp
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
These minor magic items are painted to resemble your face, 
or some metaphorical depiction thereof, to encourage the 
ushers of death to take the mask in your place. If you begin 
your turn with a dying value of 3 or greater, instead of 
making your recovery check, you lose the dying condition 
but remain unconscious at 0 Hit Points. The mask then 
cracks in half and is destroyed. The psychopomps won’t be 
so easily fooled again—you are temporarily immune to the 
effects of any psychopomp mask for 1 year.
RHINOCEROS MASK  ITEM 4+
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
Covered with thick armor and bearing 
a thicker horn, this face mask grants 
you increased momentum. If you Stride 
at least 10 feet, your next melee Strike 
before the end of your turn ignores the 
Hardness of objects with a Hardness of 
5 or less. If the object has more than Hardness 
5, the mask grants no benefit.
Type rhinoceros mask; Level 4; Price 90 gp
Type greater rhinoceros mask ; Level 8; Price 
425 gp
Your melee Strikes ignore the Hardness of 
objects with a Hardness of 10 or less.
SHAPESPEAK MASK  ITEM 4
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION
Price 80 gp 
Usage worn mask; Bulk —
This simple wooden mask is carved into the shape of an 
animal, usually tailored to a species of beast that 
the user favors. While wearing this mask, 
you can speak even when polymorphed 
into an animal. The shapespeak mask 
does not otherwise remove any 
limitations, such as the inability to cast 
spells when transformed.
SKITTERING MASK  ITEM 2+
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn mask; Bulk 1
This carved wooden full-head mask sports several 
holes along each side of the face. The first time each 
day that you begin your turn unconscious and within 
25 feet of an enemy, metallic insect legs 
emerge from the holes in the mask and 
Step 5 feet away from the nearest enemy, 
dragging your body along with the mask. If more than 
one enemy is equidistant, the mask Steps away from one 
of them at random. The mask possesses no special senses 
and does not react to hidden or undetected enemies, nor 
can it distinguish that a creature not acting openly hostile 
is an enemy.
Type skittering mask; Level 2; Price 30 gp
Type greater skittering mask; Level 8; Price 500 gp
The mask Steps 15 feet instead of 5 feet, and for 1 minute,

each time you begin your turn unconscious and within 25 
feet of an enemy, the mask Steps 15 feet away from the 
nearest enemy again. An ally can signal the mask with 
a single action, which has the auditory and concentrate 
traits. If the mask hears the signal, it attempts to move 
you towards that ally when it Steps away from the 
nearest enemy.
TLIL MASK ITEM 5+
UNCOMMON INVESTED MAGICAL TRANSMUTATION
Usage worn mask; Bulk L
Colorful, beaded tlil masks  are most commonly found on 
the distant continent of Arcadia, but trade between the 
two regions means that they can be found in the Mwangi 
Expanse as curiosities. These masks usually bear floral 
patterns and attune your senses to plants of all varieties.
Activate [one-action] envision; Frequency once per day; Effect 
Your vision up to 60 feet sees through small amounts 
of living plant matter as though it were transparent. 
While this effect is active, creatures can’t be concealed 
from you due to living plants, such as small trees, 
vines, and grass. This also prevents them from Hiding 
or Sneaking past you using only living plants for 
concealment or cover. Other than the inability to use 
the cover to Hide or Sneak, this ability doesn’t prevent 
plants from providing cover to creatures or blocking 
line of effect. It also doesn’t allow you to see through 
dead plant matter, such as the wooden walls of a 
building, or thick plant matter, such as the walls of a 
dungeon built entirely inside an enormous living tree. 
The effect lasts for 1 minute.
Type tlil mask; Level 5; Price 30 gp
Type greater tlil mask; Level 9; Price 240 gp
The effect lasts for 10 minutes.
Specialty Magic
Every student at the Magaambya has their own 
unique talents, and one purpose of the school is 
to allow students to discover these skills and hone 
them on their own terms. The following magical 
and alchemical options were all developed by the 
Magaambyan student NPCs. Heroes who befriend 
the relevant student (as explained on page 67) 
receive access to the uncommon option that the 
student knows.
ALCHEMICAL ITEM
Ignaci Canterells maintains a devotion to alchemy in 
his spare time. A hero who befriends Ignaci might 
be able to convince him to share the formula for his 
special ink, inspired by a famous Chelaxian play 
in which a scheming murderer hides poison on the 
pages of a book.
FORGETFUL INK  ITEM 6
UNCOMMON ALCHEMICAL CONSUMABLE CONTACT POISON
Price 32 gp 
Usage held in 2 hands; Bulk L
Activate [one-action] Interact
Used to write secret messages, a single dose of forgetful 
ink is enough to pen a page of text, often with flourishes 
extending to the page’s edges. Anyone handling the page 
is exposed to the poison. This includes casual reading, 
unless the reader specifically takes precautions not to 
physically touch it. Unlike other poisons, forgetful ink 
retains its potency for one year, regardless of the number 
of victims exposed.
Saving Throw DC 20 Fortitude (secret); Onset 1 minute; 
Stage 1 The reader forgets the contents of the writing, 
recalling it as blank or as inconsequential text.
LESSON
Most people don’t trust Mariama Keita’s erratic 
magic, but no one can deny that it’s as unique as she 
is. A witch who befriends Mariama can select the 
lesson of calamity when a feat or other effect grants 
a basic lesson. 
Lesson of Calamity (Uncommon):  You gain the 
stumbling curse hex, and your familiar learns ill omen 
(Advanced Player’s Guide 221).
STUMBLING CURSE  FOCUS 1
UNCOMMON CURSE HEX TRANSMUTATION WITCH
Cast [one-action] somatic
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
Saving Throw Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minute
With a twist of a finger, you send a creature careening on 
a haphazard trajectory. The target must attempt a Reflex 
save.
Critical Success  The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes a –2 status penalty to Athletics 
and Acrobatics checks.
Failure As success, and each time the target Strides, it uses 
the first 5 feet of movement of the Stride to move 5 feet 
in a random direction (this is forced movement). This has 
no effect on a creature with only 5 feet of movement.
Critical Failure As failure, except you control the direction 
of the target’s first 5 feet of movement of the Stride.
MAGIC ITEM
By persuading the spirit of a bone to listen and repeat, 
Anchor Root has enchanted this skeletal charm to 
record and play back sounds. Anchor Root typically 
uses her odd bone charms to record music, but more 
conniving minds might have other uses for them. A hero 
who befriends Anchor Root could receive (or learn how 
to make) the following magic item.

RHYTHM BONE  ITEM 1
UNCOMMON AUDITORY MAGICAL
Usage held in 1 hand; Bulk L
This small, enchanted bone (most often a jaw) is usually 
capped with metal at its ends. It’s activated by striking 
it against a hard surface.
Activate  [one-action] Interact; Effect  The bone begins recording 
the next 1 minute of ambient sounds (including speech) 
that require a DC 15 or lower Perception check to hear. 
The bone’s recording doesn’t copy magical auditory 
effects, such as those of spellcasting, a harpy’s song, 
or a banshee’s wail. Once the rhythm bone  has been 
activated in this way, it retains the recorded sound 
for the rest of its existence and can’t be activated 
this way again.
Activate [one-action] Interact; 
Effect The bone 
replays its recorded sounds.
Type rhythm bone; Level 1; Price 8 gp
Type greater rhythm bone ; Level 4; 
Price 64 gp
The magical bone records the next 10 minutes of ambient 
sounds that require a DC 20 or lower Perception check 
to hear.
Craft Requirements Supply a casting of ghost sound.
NEW SPELLS
Many students at the Magaambya have researched or 
independently developed unusual spells. 
Chizire
Chizire rarely uses this spell for anything other than 
his own convenience. 
VERMINOUS LURE  SPELL 1
UNCOMMON OLFACTORY TRANSMUTATION
Traditions primal
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature or object
Duration 10 minutes
Upon casting, the target emits a musk that’s captivating 
to certain animals. Tiny animals and animal swarms of 
any size within range must attempt a Will save. On a 
failure, non-hostile animals or animal swarms try to touch 
the target. If hostile, such creatures choose to attack 
the target instead of other foes, if able to do so without 
spending additional actions or exposing themselves to 
additional danger. 
Verminous lure  doesn’t change animals’ attitudes 
towards the target and is easily overridden by more 
direct control, such as the Command an Animal action. 
Animals with imprecise sense can use their scent as a 
precise sense against the target. 
Esi Djana
Esi has learned to channel the momentum of her 
actions into further success, though disrupting the 
flow becomes unusually jarring as a consequence. 
IMPECCABLE FLOW  SPELL 2
UNCOMMON DIVINATION LAWFUL
Traditions arcane, divine
Cast [two-actions] somatic, verbal
Duration 1 minute
You attune yourself to an underlying 
cosmic order to the world. While you 
remain in tune with this power, you gain a 
+1 status bonus to Perception checks, saving 
throws, and skill checks. If you critically fail 
any check while under the effects of this spell, 
the bonus ends and you instead have a –1 status 
penalty to all checks for the remaining duration.
Heightened (5th) The status bonus increases to 
+2.
Heightened (8th) The status bonus increases to +3.
Haibram Thodja
Never one for fine control, Haibrim’s air magic bursts 
forth from his body at wild, unpredictable angles.

UNCOMMON AIR EVOCATION
Traditions arcane, primal
Cast [one-action] verbal
Area 5-foot emanation; Targets all creatures and 
unattended objects in the area
Saving Throw Fortitude
A blast of wind wildly pushes everything nearby. 
Unattended objects of 1 Bulk or less are pushed 5 feet 
away from you. Large or smaller creatures must attempt 
a Fortitude save.
Critical Success The creature is unaffected.
Success The creature takes a –2 status penalty to checks 
made during its reactions until the end of your turn.
Failure As success, and the creature is pushed 5 feet away 
from you.
Critical Failure The creature is pushed 5 feet away from 
you and can’t use reactions until the end of your turn.
Heightened (4th) Increase the area to a 10-foot emanation 
and increase the distance objects and creatures are pushed 
to 10 feet.
Noxolo
In contrast to her lively personality, Noxolo derives 
most of her insights from the dead. This spell imparts 
the macabre perspective that Noxolo experiences from 
time to time.

GRAVE IMPRESSIONS  SPELL 2
UNCOMMON NECROMANCY
Traditions divine, occult
Cast 1 minute (somatic, verbal)
Range touch; Targets 1 corpse
Duration 10 minutes
You project a fragment of your senses into the corpse. 
While within 500 feet of the corpse (even if it’s outside 
your line of sight or line of effect), you can see from 
where the target corpse had eyes using your normal 
visual senses, and you can hear from where the corpse 
had ears using your normal auditory senses. You can 
switch between your own vision and hearing, and 
the corpse’s senses, with a single action that has the 
concentrate trait. If the corpse naturally lacked eyes or 
hearing organs in life, you cannot use that sense when 
using this spell. If the corpse is moved from its location, 
the spell ends.
Heightened (4th) The duration increases to 1 hour.
Heightened (6th) The duration lasts until the next time you 
make your daily preparations.

ANADI ALLIES
Peaceful anadis easily integrate into 
human communities so long as they 
wear their humanoid shape. Anadi 
families coexist happily with humans, 
usually making their living as tailors, 
weavers, or trappers. All too often, 
however, anadis face social stigma 
upon revealing their true forms. Most 
choose to hide this form, sharing 
their secret only with trusted friends. 
Reclusive anadis remain in the 
wilderness and avoid other ancestries 
entirely, but they domesticate giant 
spiders as trained guardians or 
hunting animals.
Anadi
Anadis have three distinct forms—human, spider, and a beautiful but 
unnerving hybrid shape that is their true form. Despite their unsettling 
arachnid features, anadis are peaceful and form tight-knit communities.
ANADI SEEKER
Anadi seekers are knowledge seekers who often brave the outside world.

Bee, Giant
Like their smaller counterparts, giant bees are highly territorial. Many 
types of giant bees construct hives in caves or abandoned buildings and 
are quick to attack creatures that they deem a threat to the single fertile 
queen, who almost never leaves the hive. Although most common in 
warm biomes with lots of vegetation, some giant bees live in arid or cold 
environments and are solitary rather than hive-dwelling. 
GIANT WORKER BEE
Worker bees, exclusively female, exist to feed and defend a hive. They have 
no qualms about sacrificing their lives when confronting intruders in their 
territory. Worker bees can fight singly, in small groups, or in swarms of 
dozens. Giant worker bees inject a venom with their stings, but this venom 
is rarely dangerous except to people sensitive to it. Other worker bees have 
no stinger and only bite their enemies.

GIANT MINING BEE
Giant mining bees have smaller bodies than giant worker 
bees but sometimes look larger due to their bristles, which 
resemble fur. They dig tunnels in sand, old wood, or stone to 
create nests and aggressively defend their lairs. Although not 
truly subterranean, giant mining bees are the most likely type 
of giant bees to be found underground, and some dwarf apiarists 
breed and train them.

HIVE MINDS
Bees communicate with each other 
using complex combinations of 
movement and pheromones. They 
can share detailed information, 
particularly related to food, water, 
and dangers. A queen bee doesn’t 
have the ability to directly control 
members of her hive, but she guides 
the entire hive’s activities and, when 
necessary, its relocation. Some druids 
have attempted to tap into this hive 
mind to control giant bee swarms, with 
limited success.

Fly, Giant Tsetse
This blood-sucking fly, the size of a horse, is widely despised as a harbinger 
of disease. Giant tsetse flies rarely congregate in large numbers, as they 
require gallons of blood each day to survive and thus crowd out or drive 
away rivals. Any group of creatures large enough to sustain multiple 
tsetse flies, such as a herd of dinosaurs, are quite likely to dominate the 
surrounding ecosystem on their own right.
A single giant tsetse fly can kill an entire herd of large animals within a 
few weeks, and those they don’t kill often succumb to disease. When not 
hunting, giant tsetse flies prefer to hide in warm, dark places in forests and 
swamps, though they sometimes inhabit wet cave systems where prey is 
plentiful. The thrumming drone of their wings echoes around such cave 
systems, warning travelers familiar with the noise that the creatures are 
lairing nearby.
If food becomes scarce, a giant tsetse fly relocates elsewhere. They tend 
to follow rivers, animal tracks, or even roads to find food. This can take 
them to the fringes of civilization, where farms and ranches often have 
livestock that draws their attention. Settlers who find evidence of a 
giant tsetse fly should quickly seek out help to eliminate the pests, 
as all their animals (and, indeed, their families) are in jeopardy as 
long as the hungry insect is near. 
Giant tsetse flies are only moderately smarter than 
ordinary flies, but some creatures have learned that they 
can train the creatures with frequent offerings of fresh 
blood. Giant tsetse flies might therefore be put to use 
as guardians or even mounts, but any potential 
trainer must take care not to become the 
voracious insect’s next meal.

UNDERESTIMATION
A group of evil druids near 
Bloodcove captured and bred large 
tsetse flies to distill and empower 
the disease they spread. The 
underestimated the flies’ ingenuity; 
the insects escaped and fed on 
several animals the druids had 
ritually prepared for sacrifice. The 
flies grew to their enormous size, 
killed the druids, and scattered into 
the surrounding fens.

Gremlin
Gremlins are malicious fey that infest and prey upon mortal communities. 
They live in tunnels, beneath eaves, and in abandoned buildings, stealing 
what they need from their neighbors instead of creating for themselves.
While there are gremlins of any and every gender, their appearances 
don’t differ by gender. Young gremlins grow to maturity with alarming 
speed. Their entire nest raises them communally, though they are often 
encouraged to wander unsupervised and create mischief away from home 
instead of inside it. 
SCRIT
Scrits are short, spindly gremlins with gray or beige leathery skin and a 
coat of smeared ink on their fingers. They make themselves the nightmare 
of many scribes and librarians, as they delight in nothing more than 
destroying books, scrolls, artwork, and other records or writing. The oils 
on a scrit’s skin smears ink and renders text—even magical writing—
completely illegible. Once they have smeared every page of a book, scrits 
devour them whole, absorbing the contents the book used to hold. After 
eating books they find stupid or funny, scrits hold skits for other gremlins 
which mock the mortal authors for the amusement of the other fey.

it Eats another Book, it replaces the benefits of the 
previous Eat Book.

GREMLIN SOCIETY
Most gremlin communities are 
egalitarian and cooperative, with 
little importance placed on familial 
ties compared to the bond of the 
community as a whole. Gremlin 
leaders are often the youngest and 
most annoying members of a group, 
achieving their positions by harassing 
an old leader into resigning or bullying 
the other gremlins into obedience. 
Gremlin adults encourage the children 
to explore by themselves, in hopes that 
they busy themselves harassing local 
mortals instead of creating trouble for 
the other gremlins.

writing such as a glyph of warding  or a sigil by succeeding at a counteract

GNAGRIF
Squat, surly, and perpetually covered in wet mud, gnagrifs are gremlins 
that infest and destroy homes. They possess sharklike faces and two sets of 
jaws, allowing them to open their mouths 180 degrees and clamp onto flat 
rocks and walls. They delight in keeping their presence hidden, chewing 
holes into walls and foundations that weaken structures but don’t bring 
them down until their inhabitants slam their doors too hard or step in the 
wrong place. Soon as the unwitting victims spring the trap, the building 
collapses around them.
Like all fey, gnagrifs detest iron. Gnagrifs become obsessively vengeful 
if they accidentally swallow an iron nail or hinge, terrorizing families or 
whole villages for generations over the slight.

GREMLIN PETS
Gremlins making their nests near 
mortals’ homes inevitably encounter 
domesticated animals. Most gremlins 
can use their innate magical abilities 
to speak with animals, allowing 
them to bargain with pets and 
work animals to aid in terrorizing, 
stealing, or training them to harass 
their owners. Gremlins especially 
love to befriend cats, whom they 
rarely bother, instead bringing them 
into their pranks and schemes as 
coconspirators.

Silverfish
A common pest with a silvery carapace and an undulating, fishlike scuttle, 
the nocturnal silverfish infests homes and libraries throughout Golarion. 
These insects aren’t typically dangerous, but their tendency to devour 
books and clothing often puts them at odds with larger creatures.
SILVERFISH SWARM
It’s uncommon for silverfish to congregate in sufficient numbers to 
constitute a swarm, but forgotten libraries or similar out-of-the-way 
places might harbor a multitude of the voracious pests.

Voracious Consumption (1 minute) A silverfish swarm consumes up to 1 Bulk of 
paper, cloth, or similar material. It can consume up to 4 Bulk each day.
GIANT SILVERFISH
Some silverfish can grow as large as a pig, particularly in magic colleges 
and ancient vault-libraries, where they terrify hapless 
students and destroy precious tomes. Popular academic 
lore attributes their unusual size to a steady diet of spellbooks.

8 Bulk each day.
SILVERFISH MOLTS
In an interesting twist to the pest’s life 
cycle, some spellcasters incorporate 
giant silverfish moltings into their 
spellbooks and scrolls. These shed 
skins have the consistency of 
onionskin and are valuable due to 
the superstition that they contain 
residual magic from texts the silverfish 
consumed. Regardless of whether 
a silverfish molt has any intrinsic 
magical power, many tenured mages 
feel that proof of a book-devouring 
vermin’s demise is worthy of a reward. 
Thus, such a trophy is guaranteed to 
fetch a tidy sum from the right buyer.

Spellskein
Magic can be used for many purposes—creating objects, summoning 
creatures, and manipulating the elements. Usually when a ritual is cast, the 
outcome is reliable and predictable, but sometimes magic takes unexpected 
turns and a spell’s energy lands in unintended places.
Spellskeins are scraps of fabric and paper infused with magic and brought 
to life. Once animated, they fold themselves into different shapes, changing 
both their appearance and their abilities based on their configuration. 
Spellskeins are only rarely aggressive and sometimes downright timid, but 
most have a playful streak. 
Though they are often made accidentally out of magical leakage 
from rituals, some ritualists intentionally create spellskeins to serve as 
magical toys or animated decor. These planned spellskeins tend to be 
more obedient and less mischievous than their accidental counterparts, 
following commands or routines set by their creators even after said 
creators are long gone.

Though her tiny stature and canine features would 
never suggest it, Kurshkin is an immortal trickster 
older than most members of the Magaambya. As 
a gremlin—a category of mischievous, malevolent 
fey—Kurshkin has spent most of her life with no real 
motives beyond childish cruelty. Like most pugwampi 
gremlins, Kurshkin delights in the misfortune of others, 
and especially enjoying making bad situations worse 
by introducing wasps, bleach, or other humiliating 
and painful substances to a situation where people are 
already suffering.
After decades of tormenting workers and artists on 
the outskirts of Nantambu, several members of the 
squabbling collective of gremlins that Kurshkin was a 
part of developed a grudge against one of the youths 
that often helped out around the city—an obnoxiously 
mellow and good-humored young man named Takulu 
Ot. The young man was a student at the Magaambya 
with a terrible habit of helping people keep a 
positive attitude in bad circumstances. In a display of 
uncharacteristic boldness, the gremlins ventured into 
the academy to enact their revenge on the youth and 
the entire school. They knew that historically, gremlins 
tended to eschew the academy, but they didn’t know 
why. Kurshkin, in particular, considered herself far too 
clever to have anything to fear at the Magaambya. 
After all, the academy only held people, and people 
are fun to torment. 
Unsurprisingly, the gremlins found they had bitten 
off more than they could chew in deciding to take on 
a university filled with mages. Kurshkin was one of 
the first “casualties” of the offensive—caught by a deft 
student, the pugwampi was stuffed in a sack, loaded 
onto an elephant, and was two weeks of travel away 
from Nantambu before she managed to chew her way 
out of her confinement.
By the time Kurshkin made it back to the 
Magaambya, all of her fellow gremlins were dead.
Though the pugwampi’s first impulse was to run 
and hide, she was also paranoid that the killer would 
be coming for her next. Kurshkin began to spy on the 
campus, looking for any sign of a continued threat. In 
her vigil, she found herself paying attention to some of 
the magical lessons being taught at the school. After 
years of inadvertent osmosis, she even managed to 
develop a few new magical tricks of her own.
The Magaambya’s philosophy of understanding 
others and overcoming differences worked in 
Kurshkin’s favor. If a few teachers or staff members 
noticed a creature that would skitter off when spotted, 
and seemed to be doing no harm, they said nothing 
about it. Kurshkin’s caution eventually waned to the 
point where she would risk a few pranks on students, 
but her fear of attracting attention meant these tricks 
were all effectively harmless, and many of the scholars 
considered the gremlin’s mischief to be a good lesson 
to teach students some care. Whether or not this 
situation would have remained tenable on its own is 
debatable, but it unraveled as soon as the being known 
as Stone Ghost reached out to Kurshkin.
A strange creature that manifested from the rock of 
the Magaambya’s walls, Stone Ghost was recruiting 
gremlins for his schemes against the university. He 
originally approached Kurshkin as a kindred spirit, 
promising a chance at revenge. When Kurshkin 
refused, citing what had happened to her own vengeful 
comrades, Stone Ghost revised his offer: obey, or Stone 
Ghost would kill her.
It quickly became apparent that Kurshkin was 
somehow the most competent among Stone Ghost’s 
gathered gremlins, and she was happy to take the 
leadership position and heap abuse on her underlings. 
A firm believer in leading from the back, Kurshkin 
obeys Stone Ghost’s orders by telling her fellows what 
to do while she remains safe and sound, far away from 
any blowback their malicious antics might incur. 
Like most pugwampis, Kurshkin resembles a dog 
that has lost most of its fur to mange. Her head is 
too big for her body, and her eyes nearly seem to be 
popping out of their sockets. She has large, floppy ears 
but is mostly deaf. During her time at the Magaambya, 
her eyes have turned bright blue in color—a quirk that 
her fellow gremlins both mock and fear. Her clothing 
is unusually fine for a gremlin, due to her scavenging 
from the Magaambya’s well-to-do students, and 
has become somewhat vain and fussy about what

she wears. She enjoys decorating herself with threads 
or scraps of cloth that have been ripped off of students 
by mischance due to her unlucky aura.
CAMPAIGN ROLE
Kurshkin serves as a secondary villain to the 
adventure, a somewhat silly antagonist who can be 
dangerous nevertheless—if underestimated. Despite 
her sympathetic circumstances, she is still unrepentant 
in her malice. 
In combat, Kurshkin relies on her unluck aura to 
keep her safe, darting close to foes and hoping the 
ensuring misfortune will cause them to deal more 
harm to each other than to her. If her enemies seem too 
competent, she’s happy to abandon her subordinates 
to her foes’ whims so that she can flee to safety. 
Kurshkin is a petty sort of evil, the kind that delights 
in causing others misfortune because she thinks it’s 
funny. While she’s never done anything that warrants 
death by most human standards, it’s undeniable that 
her presence and actions make people miserable and 
situations worse. 
Her dislike of deadly violence is mainly due to 
cowardice and the fact that she finds corpses to be less 
entertaining than living victims. This doesn’t mean she 
won’t stick a sword on someone who makes her mad 
by spoiling her fun; she’s done so many times before, 
and likely will again. Even if the heroes deal with 
Kurshkin without lethal measures, she still endeavors 
to slowly grind down everyone around her, one minor 
annoyance at a time.

As a young man, Uduak Basni seemed like a typical 
Magaambyan initiate. Born with a supernatural 
connection to the earth, he found himself drawn to the 
Magaambya. To the professors at the academy, Uduak 
was an obvious candidate for the school’s education. 
He easily found a sponsor and was set upon his 
Perquisite to become a full-fledged attendant.
Yet Uduak had a selfish streak. The pull he felt 
toward the Magaambya quickly bred a sense of 
entitlement. Feeling that he was meant to be building 
his own skills at the academy, he felt resentful about 
the community service he felt was being forced upon 
him. He performed his tasks with little effort and little 
concern for the people he was supposedly helping. 
Cracks began to form in his mild demeanor, and he 
increasingly drew reprimands for acts of carelessness 
or petty cruelty. Everything came to a head when his 
cohort was tasked with removing a group of pugwampi 
gremlins that had started causing mischief within the 
academy walls. Ignoring the spirited discussions of his 
fellow initiates, Uduak used his magic to slaughter the 
gremlins like vermin.
The aftermath saw Uduak expelled from the school. 
It was the last straw in a long series of misdeeds, but 
the young man fixated on this one event, enraged 
that the school would rob him of his future over 
defending himself and his classmates from a group 
of mere pests. In his anger, he lashed out violently at 
the school and the teachers. His magic bounced off 
the ancient wards of the Magaambya like a pebble 
off a cliff, and the professors temporarily confined 
Uduak until the administration could decide what 
to do with him. Left to stew in his own resentment, 
Uduak ignored his guard’s warning, drew on all of his 
strength, and attempted to shatter the spells that kept 
him imprisoned within his room.
Under predictable circumstances, Uduak’s magic 
would have splashed futilely against the Magaambya’s 
wards once more, leaving his efforts entirely 
impotent. Yet magic is never entirely predictable—or 
perhaps the murdered pugwampis got one last scrap 
of revenge. In an incredibly unlikely reaction, the 
Magaambya’s wards rebounded onto Uduak with the 
full force of their power. So far as any teacher at the 
school could tell, this reaction evaporated Uduak on 
the spot.
The student that was Uduak was not gone, however, 
but found himself merged with the Magaambya’s stone 
walls. The same wards that originally trapped him 
within the buildings now protected him from detection, 
and Uduak decided to use this to his advantage. He 
hid himself in an abandoned section of the school and 
began planning his vengeance. His first recruits to his 
cause were an assorted group of gremlins that snuck 
into the school with no clue as to the recent massacre 
of their kind. Through a series of promises and threats, 
the cursed student took command of the gremlins, 
considering it fitting that the initiators of his downfall 
would now serve him against the teachers who had so 
wronged him. The gremlins, impressed and fearful of 
their new leader’s ability to move through stone walls, 
granted him a new moniker: Stone Ghost.
Stone Ghost resembles a young man with a body 
made out of chunks of stone, his faceted skin matching 
the blocks that make up the Magaambya campus. His 
hair and face are made of ruined mosaics, and his body 
is covered in fragmentary runes: the shattered remains 
of the magic wards that caused his current condition. 
With nothing to temper his cruelty, Stone Ghost is 
abusive both in and out of combat. During his spare 
time, he shifts through walls to steal important items, 
learn secrets, and ruin friendships. 
CAMPAIGN ROLE
Stone Ghost serves as the villain of this adventure. 
He’s a spiteful and self-centered antagonist convinced 
he’s been victimized and willing to take out his feelings 
on the vulnerable. Due to his fear of the Magaambyan 
teachers, he almost always targets weak and innocent 
school initiates or adjuncts, punishing them for their 
mere association with the professors. He has recently 
worked to corral the insects and other creatures—
including gremlins—that have been mysteriously 
drawn to the school, waiting for the perfect moment 
to unleash them for his own ends. As his minions can’t 
move about the academy as easily has he can, Stone

Takulu was born in the scholarly town of Tunyani, a 
settlement dedicated to the worship of the Empyreal 
Lords of magic and knowledge. Due to protection 
agreements held with the Tempest-Sun Mages of 
Nantambu, Tunyani’s people were afforded the luxury 
of scholarly focus, with no need for its youths to 
train as warriors or soldiers. Instead, custom dictated 
the eldest child of every family would be sent to the 
priests and become a theologian. Takulu, first born to 
his parents, arrived at the temples at the age of five. 
Though he clearly disliked the separation from the 
rest of his family, Takulu took to his initial lessons 
well, soon excelling in his studies beyond what even 
the most learned scholars of Tunyani could offer him. 
Recognizing their son would never be happy where he 
was, stifled in both mind and spirit, Takulu’s parents 
invoked a different tradition—a gift of a sacred ibis 
went to the Empyreal scholars, and Takulu went to 
the Magaambya. 
Takulu had a considerate and kind nature even as a 
youth, and he immediately took to the Magaambyan 
ideals of responsibility and community service. He 
impressed his teachers with his thoughtfulness and 
his almost-supernatural levels of calm when dealing 
with difficult situations. His friendly and accepting 
demeanor meant that Takulu often found himself 
making friends with the unpopular or less successful 
students, helping them overcome bullying, shyness, 
and other social challenges to excel. These efforts 
found him surrounded by loyal friends and grateful 
acquaintances as he advanced his academic career. A 
year after achieving Conversant rank, he married his 
wife, a talented glass artist living in Nantambu; their 
relationship remains quietly happy and unshakable to 
this day.
For over a decade, he was content, and this was 
enough. Yet as Takulu watched the next generation 
of Magaambya initiates work their way through their 
studies, he began to realize his beloved academy had 
flaws. The school was incredibly understanding of 
different methods of learning, but could be callous 
when it came to supporting students emotionally. 
The self-directed studies that had offered Takulu the 
freedom to pursue his own interests allowed similarly 
self-directed and ambitious students to flourish but 
left those less certain of their path in life adrift and 
lost. The Magaambya’s teachers maintained informal 
schedules and often forced students to seek them 
out, considering the journey a valuable lesson, yet 
this method actively favored those with more social 
confidence. Recognizing that talented youths were 
being left behind by the Magaambya’s practices, 
Takulu turned his research to a field that had often 
taken second place to other academic concerns at the 
university—the study of teaching itself.
Like many subjects at the Magaambya, several scholars 
had dabbled in this research, but their knowledge had 
never been aggregated or catalogued. Takulu began the 
slow process of testing these approaches and adding his 
own refinements. He volunteered to personally teach 
many of the new initiates, a task that was usually left up 
to older students. The scholar also continued to tutor 
students that failed to thrive, doing what he could to 
learn the best methods of organizing lessons to help the 
most people learn. 
Imparting his knowledge to the rest of the 
Magaambya has been slow. Teachers who thrived 
under the self-guided tutelage of their mentors 
prefer things to remain as they are. Others approve 
of Takulu’s goals but consider the implementation a 
project for him and his like-minded students, rather 
than something to be broadly embraced. For now, 
Takulu has satisfied his ambitions by making himself 
a resource to a generation of incoming initiates and 
by keeping notes on his process and observations 
with the same precision that he applies to all of his 
scholarly pursuits.
In addition to his knowledge of magic and 
mathematics, Takulu is a skilled diplomat, as he deals 
with irate students and reticent academics on a daily 
basis. He’s also a very capable mbira player. When not 
teaching, he can be found watching birds on campus 
or out in the city of Nantambu, where he’s usually 
accompanied by his wife.
Physically, Takulu is an average-looking man with 
a friendly smile. He wears clothing with crisp patterns

and happy colors, which somehow never have a 
wrinkle on them no matter what the teacher has 
been doing recently. He has a favored wooden staff 
that he almost always carries with him—a gift from 
a student, which sometimes sprouts a tiny fruit or 
attracts a brave songbird—and also carries or wears 
a small trinket in the shape of an anteater, as he has 
a well-known and innocent delight for the animals. 
His wholesome image often causes students to gossip 
about him, making up conspiracy theories of violent 
hobbies or a secret dark past, but 
there’s no truth to these haphazard 
stories. Takulu really is everything he 
appears to be.
CAMPAIGN ROLE
Takulu is the first impression of the 
Magaambya that this campaign offers, 
serving as a kindly mentor to the heroes while 
they are students and a reliable ally to them 
after they outgrow his guidance. Even-tempered 
and unbearably kind, Takulu can offer advice and 
help to heroes who are struggling, including being 
a mouthpiece for you to provide suggestions to 
players who are struggling to find their character’s 
role in the campaign. Although he answers to 
Takulu when faculty members speak to him, 
he prefers that students call him “Teacher 
Ot.” When not teaching, he can usually be 
found in his office on the top floor of the  
Heron Archives.
If placed into a dangerous situation, 
Takulu’s first goal is to protect his 
students, then anyone else in the area 
who requires assistance. He isn’t a violent 
man, nor is he very good at violence even if he 
tries, meaning any combat aid he might offer in the 
course of the Adventure Path is firmly relegated 
to a support role.
