Magic
The devastation of Earthfall resulted in the slaughter 
of billions, and the widespread destruction of most 
civilization erased much of humanity’s knowledge. The 
man credited with bringing magic back to humanity was 
Old‑Mage Jatembe, a folk hero and a myth to the people 
of the Mwangi Expanse. During the Age of Anguish that 
followed Earthfall, Old‑Mage Jatembe and his students, 
the Ten Magic Warriors, traveled the Mwangi Expanse 
and beyond to deliver lore, and with it, hope. Perhaps the 
greatest and most long‑lasting of Jatembe’s achievements 
was founding the oldest (and arguably greatest) magic 
school in the world, the Magaambya.
The Magaambya
To this day the Magaambya strives to spread the same 
knowledge and hope that Old‑Mage Jatembe and the 
Ten Magic Warriors did long ago. Teaching a blend of 
arcane and primal traditions, the Magaambya aims to 
do more than educate wizards and druids; it hopes to 
act in service to the whole of Golarion.
The hierarchy of the Magaambya is as old as the 
school. Newcomers begin as initiates, and each chooses 
one of the school’s five educational facets, called 
branches: visionary Cascade Bearers, sociable Emerald 
Boughs, curious Rain‑Scribes, valorous Tempest‑Sun 
Mages, and story‑filled Uzunjati. Initiates engage in 
a period of public service called a Perquisite before 
they become attendants. Attendants receive a wooden 
mask (typically resembling an animal) that holds a 
fragment of the student’s spirit and reflects their spirit 
face. Those deemed to possess enough self‑direction 
to serve the school more broadly become conversants. 
After demonstrating sufficient mastery of Magaambyan 
techniques, a conversant becomes a lore-speaker. All 
teachers at the Magaambya are lore‑speakers.
The player characters advance through these ranks 
together (though their branches may differ), beginning 
as initiates and becoming lore‑speakers at the end of 
the second adventure. They take on the role of teachers 
for the rest of the Adventure Path. 
The Vesicant Egg
Old‑Mage Jatembe faced many evil forces to help 
bring the world back into light, and perhaps none 
were as insidious as the King of Biting Ants. Taking the 
form of a massive swarm of ants—held together only 
by a single, prodigious will—the King used the magic 
of the Doorway to the Red Star, a powerful gateway 
located in the Mwangi jungles, to dominate the 
Mwangi Expanse. Jatembe traveled to the Doorway 
and fought the King of Biting Ants, scattering his form 
and driving him through the Doorway along with his 
ageless acolytes. The King of Biting Ants was banished 
and his evil quelled for thousands of years. 
Once he knew defeat was imminent, the King of 
Biting Ants hatched a plan. He hid tiny pieces of his 
psyche in the creeping, crawling insects of the ruins 
around the Doorway. Eventually, several of these 
mental fragments came together to create a magical 
insect egg, from which the King of Biting Ants might 
one day exert his evil will again. 
This artifact, known as the Vesicant Egg is about a 
foot in diameter, with many strange powers the heroes 
will experience firsthand. Just prior to the events of the 
campaign, the Vesicant Egg ended up in the hands of 
Koride Ulawa, a teacher at the Magaambya, who finds 
the artifact a compelling puzzle but is wholly unaware 
of its connection to the King of Biting Ants.
Campaign Summary
The campaign’s six adventures are summarized below.
KINDLED MAGIC
By Alexandria Bustion and Eleanor Ferron
Pathfinder Adventure Path #169, Levels 1–3
The heroes arrive at the Magaambya as the school’s 
newest students, which means they must engage in 
public service to the school. In doing so, they learn 
that some strange force is drawing insects towards 
the campus, including monstrous ones. The heroes 
must overcome gremlin troublemakers and a bitter

ex‑student to keep the peace. While these events 
unfold, the heroes must engage in ordinary student 
life, such as deciding the specific branches of study to 
pursue and receiving the animal masks that show their 
spirit faces.
SPOKEN ON THE SONG WIND
By Quinn Murphy
Pathfinder Adventure Path #170, Levels 4–7
Trusted to handle school business in 
the surrounding city of Nantambu, the 
Song‑Wind City, the heroes discover they 
aren’t the only ones curious about the strange 
force attracting infestations of insects. They 
also contend with a grippli crime boss, 
uncover stealthy serpentfolk infiltrators, 
and keep up with their classes. At the end 
of this adventure, the students become 
full graduates and are entitled to call 
themselves lore‑speakers. 
HURRICANE’S HOWL
By Michelle Jones
Pathfinder Adventure Path #171, Levels 8–11
As new teachers of the Magaambya, the heroes are 
assigned several students to instruct. When one 
goes missing due to family concerns back home, the 
heroes combine their search with a field trip. Taking 
their students to Terwa Lake, the heroes rescue a 
village under threat and uncover lost treasures in the 
ruined city of Bloodsalt. When the wicked Knights 
of Abendego destroy the village and kidnap its 
inhabitants, the heroes must pursue them into the 
Sodden Lands and put a stop to their evil. 
SECRETS OF THE TEMPLE-CITY
By Luis Loza
Pathfinder Adventure Path #172, Levels 12–14
As esteemed representatives of the Magaambya, the 
heroes join a diplomatic expedition to the dangerous 
city of Mzali. There, they must negotiate with the 
city’s evil leaders for expanded trade rights. The heroes 
also uncover a route to the hidden city of Osibu. 
Able to experience this legendary city with their 
students in tow, the heroes arrive and make friends 
with its inhabitants, including the ancient arboreal 
Dimari‑Diji. Forces from Mzali, having also learned 
the route, besiege the city, and the heroes must aid 
in its defense. When they demonstrate their bravery, 
Dimari‑Diji confides in them that Old‑Mage Jatembe 
might be in some trouble on the planet Akiton, which 
the heroes can reach through the mystical Doorway to 
the Red Star.
DOORWAY TO THE RED STAR
By Michael Sayre
Pathfinder Adventure Path #173, Levels 15–17
The heroes negotiate with the guardians of the 
Doorway to the Red Star to gain passage to the 
mystical gate and learn how to travel through it to 
Akiton. Once there, enigmatic, bulbous‑brained 
creatures called the Contemplatives of Ashok 
need the heroes’ help, offering information 
in exchange. They reveal that the King of 
Biting Ants has imprisoned Jatembe aboard 
the King’s fortress airship, Mandibles of 
Fate. The heroes must infiltrate this airship 
and find Jatembe, but they soon learn the 
King has nearly completed a superweapon 
capable of reshaping Golarion. The heroes 
must put a stop to the insectile sorcerer and 
return to Golarion with Jatembe.
SHADOWS OF THE ANCIENTS
By Saif Ansari
Pathfinder Adventure Path #174, 
Levels 18–20
Old‑Mage Jatembe appoints the heroes his new Magic 
Warriors in a ceremony back at the Magaambya. Yet 
the heroes’ defeat of the King of Biting Ants awakened 
his latent sentience within the Vesicant Egg, which now 
works to restore him. To stop the evil plan hatching 
within the egg, the heroes must overcome trials while 
shrunk to the size of ants and confront a maggot large 
enough to crush the school—earning the Magaambya 
a powerful new guardian in the process.
Key Names
The following are key proper names to keep track of in 
this Adventure Path. 
Ahassunu Teacher; absentminded female iruxi historian.
Ajbal Kimon Evil male human leader of the wicked Knights 
of Abendego.
Akiton A red, dusty planet in Golarion’s solar system.
Anchor Root Student; anxious female ant gnoll.
WHAT’S COMMON?
The assumption of a common language is useful in any 
campaign. In the Strength of Thousands Adventure 
Path, references to the “Common” language (such as 
in creature stat blocks) refer to Mwangi, rather than 
Taldane. All player characters have Mwangi as their 
default common language. They can pick up Taldane 
if they’d like, but won’t have a lot of use for it.

Campaign Timeline
Key events leading up to the start of the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path are listed below. 
Date Event
Age of Legend The Contemplatives of Ashok on the distant planet of Akiton establish the Doorway to the Red Star 
to observe Golarion and bring their learning to the young planet. The Throat-of-Nothingness cult 
builds a cathedral complex around the Doorway before succumbing to self-destruction and nihilism.
–4294 ar  Skies clear from the impact of Earthfall, and the Age of Anguish begins. Desperate people struggle 
for survival around the world. 
Approx. –3600 The first rumors of the clever and benevolent Old-Mage Jatembe—an old man, even in the oldest 
legends about him—begin circulating in the Mwangi Expanse. 
–3505 A wicked sorcerer called the King of Biting Ants uses the Doorway’s powers to dominate the 
surrounding region. Old-Mage Jatembe vanquishes him and banishes him to Akiton. The King leaves

–3504 Old-Mage Jatembe chooses his Ten Magic Warriors to restore the light of learning to Garund. 
–3502 Jatembe founds the city of Nantambu and the Magaambya academy at its heart. Sightings of 
Jatembe continue for centuries as his legend grows, but he effectively disappears around this time. 
His Ten Magic Warriors continue to guide and serve the people of the Mwangi Expanse.
4455 Jatembe travels to Akiton, only to be imprisoned by the King of Biting Ants aboard the King’s 
fortress-airship, Mandibles of Fate. While pretending to languish in prison, Jatembe secretly 
sabotages and delays the King’s attempts to construct a superweapon to destroy Golarion.
4606 The permanent, ferocious hurricane known as the Eye of Abendego forms off of the coast of what 
will become the Sodden Lands. The mountaintop community of Jula becomes a coastal town.
4610 Walkena, the mummified child-god of Mzali, begins his rule of the city with a brutal, iron fist. 
4680 Father Heveril, a fallen paladin of Erastil, becomes the leader of Jula.
4699 Evil Norgorber worshippers with the grandiose name of the “Knights of Abendego” arrive in Jula and 
begin asserting their control over the region.
4705 The King of Biting Ants learns of Jatembe’s sabotage and, without Jatembe’s knowledge, begins 
perfecting a second, secret version of his superweapon.
4719 Koride Ulawa discovers the Vesicant Egg and brings it to her hidden laboratory at the Magaambya. 
She is ignorant of its connection to the King of Biting Ants.
4721 The current year. The heroes arrive at the Magaambya to begin their academic careers.

4 The heroes should reach 4th level by the end of the adventure.
Chapter 1: Orientation  ................................................. 8
The Magaambya’s newest students must undertake an unusual interview 
before settling into their dormitory and meeting their peers. A week of 
service projects ends with a formal introduction ceremony, but gremlin 
saboteurs disrupt the preparations and try to make a quick end of the 
heroes’ academic careers. 
Chapter 2: First of Many  ........................................... 28
Settling into their class routines, the heroes perform service missions to 
gain favor with some of the Magaambya’s teachers. Throughout these 
missions, the heroes learn about an unusually high amount of insect 
activity at the school. During their solemn First Masking ceremony, giant 
insects burst from the walls and attack.
Chapter 3: Stone-Cast Shadows  ............................... 46
The insect attack during the First Masking reveals a sprawling warren 
of caves and tunnels beneath the school. The heroes receive the task of 
exploring the most distant and ostensibly safest tunnels, but they end up 
face‑to‑face with the vengeful ex‑student behind the recent attacks.
LEARNING EXPERIENCE
A campaign where students attend 
a magic school wouldn’t seem very 
magical unless all the heroes can 
cast spells. Every character gains 
the druid multiclass archetype (Core 
Rulebook 225) or wizard multiclass 
archetype (Core Rulebook 231) to 
reflect the primal and arcane teaching 
traditions of the school. More details 
are provided in the free Strength of 
Thousands Player’s Guide, and specific 
details about free archetypes can be 
found on page 194 of the Pathfinder 
Gamemastery Guide.
Throughout the Strength of 
Thousands Adventure Path, the 
heroes gain XP not from winning 
fights, but from solving mysteries, 
aiding others, or even just making 
friends. If character advancement 
in this campaign feels different than 
it does in other campaigns, that’s 
perfectly fine! There are plenty of 
thrilling combats in store, but much 
of the “magic school” experience 
comes from helping peers, earning 
teachers’ trust, or even getting into 
some trouble. Hopefully, your players 
learn early on—perhaps as soon as 
their initial interview with Teacher 
Ot—that their characters gain XP 
for these things. You should reward 
the heroes with full XP for creative 
solutions to bypassing hazards 
or monsters, as if the heroes had 
overcome the challenges in the usual 
manner; this might convince them 
to find inventive solutions to the 
inevitable combats.

Old-Mage Jatembe was the most powerful man in the world. Wherever he went, he spread hope 
and light to the people around him. All of the good things in the world were awed by Jatembe 
and came to give him secrets. All of the foul creatures declared war on him, but Jatembe stole 
their magic and banished them. In this way, Jatembe turned a world of ash into the beautiful 
land we have today, filled with fish and animals, grains and palm trees, sweet yams and red 
soil. The foul beasts wailed at their realms of ash and terror being transformed into rich and 
wonderful lands, but they all feared Jatembe.
One day, a creeping bad-luck spirit inched forth from the grass. It was too young and foolish 
to know its limits and thought, “I will take vengeance on Jatembe and laugh at his misery.” 
The spirit crawled into the nearby village and asked where Jatembe was, but no one could 
answer. It asked then where the riches of Jatembe were, but people said they knew of none. It 
asked where the spouses of Jatembe were, but the people could not name anyone he had married. 
It asked where the weapons of Jatembe were, but the old mage’s greatest weapon had always been 
the knowledge he kept in his head.
Frustrated, the little spirit demanded, “What manner of great man can this Jatembe be, if he 
has no riches, no wives, no husbands, no weapons, nor any children?” 
Yet Jatembe had many children, the people answered, as they showed the little spirit the great 
city of Nantambu where thousands and thousands of students learned, worked, and helped 
each other by Jatembe’s words. The little spirit decided that if it couldn’t have vengeance on 
Jatembe, it would do so upon his children. The spirit listened until it found a voice that told 
it how to get inside. Following the voice, it crept into the city through the tiny cracks in the 
buildings’ walls, so small that even an ant would have to squeeze, but Jatembe’s students 
caught the spirit and tossed it out like a harmless grass snake. The spirit became terribly 
angry at its treatment but could do nothing on its own, and so it sought out others like itself 
to creep back inside and strike using the distraction of a celebration...

This adventure begins when the heroes arrive together at the Magaambya 
Academy as initiates. The Magaambya has a beautiful campus with massive 
mosaics of Jatembe’s Ten Magic Warriors overlooking the school’s terraced 
gardens and the surrounding city of Nantambu —a beautiful view only slightly 
spoiled at the moment by a powerful rainstorm. The heroes of this adventure 
are assumed to be young adults or older, to have secured a sponsor for their 
attendance at the academy, and to have just embarked on their Perquisite—a 
period of public service (usually lasting a year) that entitles new initiates to 
attend classes as well as receive school housing and stipends.
The Magaambyan instructor Takulu Ot (page 90), a human man with 
colorful clothing and warm eyes, meets the collected group of heroes. 
Once the heroes have all assembled, Takulu arrives to address them, read 
or paraphrase the following.
The teacher speaks with a gentle, soothing timbre. “Welcome, and a kind hello, 
new students. It is my pleasure to instruct you. You may call me Teacher Ot. You 
are embarking now on a life of study and service. We see within you intellect, 
passion, and judgment—in short, the virtues to build upon the strengths of the 
thousands who have come before you. We follow the footsteps of Old-Mage 
Jatembe, who showed us that the price of magic is the responsibility to better 
the world.” 
Takulu has not just come to welcome new students—he’s also here to 
conduct the customary interview initiates receive before being accepted 
into the Magaambya. During their backstory, some heroes might have 
had individual interviews with the sponsor that recommended them to the 
university, which may have included picking out their branches. They’re 
presumed to have sufficiently distinguished themselves during those 
interviews to initially earn their place at the Magaambya, but they must 
do the introductory interview with Takulu regardless.
Group Interview
No matter how the heroes came to the Magaambya, Takulu conducts 
a group interview with all of them. Aside from the in‑world purpose of 
allowing Takulu to learn more about the new students, this interview is a 
great time for the players to introduce their characters, learn more about 
each other, establish pre‑adventure relationships or connections based on 
the given answers, and get into the mindset of working with one another 
at a magical school before moving on to the rest of the adventure. You can 
shorten or expand this introductory session to suit your group’s needs. 
CHAPTER 1 SYNOPSIS
In this chapter, the heroes arrive 
at the Magaambya as new 
students. They engage in a curious 
introductory interview with the 
kindly Takulu Ot before getting 
a tour of their dormitory. During 
this tour, the heroes can start 
making friends with some of their 
peers. For each of the following 
five days, the heroes engage in 
service projects keyed to one of 
the Magaambya’s five branches: 
Rain-Scribes, Tempest-Sun Mages, 
Cascade Bearers, Emerald Boughs, 
and Uzunjati. After these five days 
of service, the heroes are scheduled 
for the Introduction Ceremony. A 
gremlin attack disrupts this event 
and hints at larger problems at 
the Magaambya.
CHAPTER 1 TREASURE
This chapter doesn’t provide many 
items, as the bulk of the heroes’ 
treasure is in their initial stipend for 
becoming students. The permanent 
and consumable items available as 
treasure in Chapter 1 are as follows. 
• +1 handwraps of mighty fists 
• hand of the mage
• holly bush feather token
• wolf fang

This interview can even serve as an introductory 
pre‑campaign session to help you and the players build 
their characters together.
QUESTIONS
Takulu begins the assessment with very basic, though 
still important, questions for each new student. Feel 
free to intersperse these questions throughout the 
aptitude tests below; the interview should feel more 
like a conversation than an interrogation.
• “Who are you?”
• “What most interests you?”
• “What do you consider your greatest strength?”
• “What work have you done to bolster those in 
and around the Magaambya before now?” 
• “What do you seek at the Magaambya?”
• “Once you have attained that which you seek, 
what goals do you wish to achieve?”
Takulu doesn’t expect deep answers to these questions, 
as he knows that some heroes might not have deeply 
considered these matters, but he expects thoughtfulness 
and he wants to see how they frame their responses.
APTITUDE TESTS
Along with these simple questions, the interview 
involves a short series of aptitude tests for the 
heroes, which present challenges for the students to 
overcome with their skills. Takulu doesn’t mind if a 
student declines a challenge; he understands that new 
students might reasonably lack the magic or skills to 
accomplish every task.
These tests could have many solutions depending 
on a specific character’s abilities. Although the easiest 
solution to each test involves magic, Takulu also 
encourages the creative use of mundane abilities—
he strongly believes (and gently reminds reluctant 
or frustrated heroes) that there’s magic in everyday 
solutions as well. He’s also pleased whenever students 
solve an issue by working together. Feel free to 
encourage players who find creative solutions to these 
tasks outside of the stated suggestions below, perhaps 
including a skill check that has a similar DC to the 
ones given here. 
“Can you light this candle without flint or matches?” 
Any spell that produces flame lights the candle. A hero 
who succeeds at a DC 18 Survival check can also start 
a fire by rubbing kindling or a similar substance that 
isn’t flint or a match. Due to the rain, there isn’t a lot 
of suitable wood at hand; however, if the hero has dry 
wood or tinder, reduce the DC of this check by 5.
“Can you get a feather from this bird without 
plucking one?” Takulu coos to call forth a blue quail 
tame enough to flee only if someone gets too close. 
A hero with wild empathy or another such ability 
to communicate with the shy bird can convince it to 
pull or shake loose a feather with a successful DC 13 
Diplomacy check. Luring the bird near something 
sticky (like honey) or rough (like bark) to snag a 
feather requires a successful a DC 13 Nature or 
Survival check. A hero who scares the bird with a spell 
like fear or who succeeds at a DC 16 Intimidation 
check frightens the bird into flapping its wings and 
dislodging a feather.
“Can you get a secret from this snake?”  Takulu 
presents a small, harmless Garundi shovel‑snout snake 
with distinctive scale patterns. A hero who succeeds 
at a DC 17 Occultism check while looking over the 
patterns realizes that the snake was born alongside 
a shadow twin who watches events from the spirit 
world. Additionally, a hero who handles the snake 
identifies a hidden spike on the snake’s tail with a 
successful DC 15 Perception or Nature check. Finally, 
a hero who looks over the snake and succeeds at a 
DC 14 Medicine check realizes that the snake is blind 
in one eye. Takulu counts any of these facts as a secret.
“Can you soothe the soul of this bone?”  This test 
is somewhat a trick question, as Takulu knows that 
the heroes are unlikely to have higher ‑level spells like 
gentle repose  or rest eternal . However, a hero who 
succeeds at a DC 15 Religion, Performance, or Society 
check (or a check with an appropriate Lore skill) 
knows a socially appropriate funeral rite to perform 
on the bone. Takulu considers anyone attempting to 
cast the soothe spell on the bone a bit too clever for 
their own good, but he counts that approach as a 
success as well.
“Can you make this stone dance by itself?” This test 
is another trick question. The heroes might inquire 
what counts as “by itself,” but Takulu simply tells 
them to use their own judgment. He knows that most 
students lack the animate object ritual to perform the 
most direct solution to the problem, but he accepts 
spells that move the rock, such as gust of wind  
or unseen servant. A hero who succeed at a DC 17 
Acrobatics, Athletics, or Thievery check can skip or 
spin the rock with sufficient force that it continues 
moving by itself long enough for Takulu to count the 
attempt as a success.
XP Award: Grant the heroes 30 XP for each aptitude 
test they pass, to a maximum of 150 XP.
MAGIC SYMBOLS
Takulu magically conjures glowing symbols in the air 
and says, “You see six symbols before you. Which do 
you choose?” These symbols might seem related to 
the questions and the aptitude tests, but they serve

a different function: they help kindle the characters’ 
innate magical talent into a spell. He waits until all the 
heroes have chosen a symbol (or opted to not choose 
any symbol at all, which he respects as a choice). 
Multiple heroes can choose the same symbol.
A hero who selects a symbol gains a cantrip as an 
innate spell, which they can cast at will. If the hero 
already knows the cantrip, choose another arcane or 
primal cantrip the hero doesn’t already know that 
seems appropriate for their symbol choice. The hero 
keeps this cantrip until they learn to cast another 
cantrip from any other source (which is likely to be 
when they acquire the druid or wizard multiclass 
archetype upon reaching 2nd level). At that point, the 
greater magical lore they’ve unlocked replaces this 
minor spark of magic. A hero who doesn’t choose 
a symbol doesn’t get a cantrip but gains a +1 status 
bonus to saving throws against spells until they reach 
2nd level.
Flickering Candle: The hero gains dancing lights as 
a primal innate spell.
Balanced Scales:  The hero gains guidance as a 
primal innate spell.
Multipronged Key: The hero gains mage hand as an 
arcane innate spell.
Pursed Lips: The hero gains message as an arcane 
innate spell.
Open Hand with an Eye in the Palm: The hero gains 
shield as an arcane innate spell.
Running Hourglass:  The hero gains stabilize as a 
primal innate spell.
FINAL QUESTION
Takulu has one final question for the heroes, but 
he doesn’t require an answer right away. Read or 
paraphrase the following.
“At the Magaambya, we seek to understand our differences. 
Where others might dismiss a trait as irrelevant or 
troublesome, we understand that the things that make us 
unique in life are key to who we are as people. And it is 
who we are as people that defines our magic. Sometimes, 
it is things that are different about us, things that societies 
have taught us to hate, that show what our talent will be. 
To the north, people say that children with white or red 
hair have strong potential for magic. Here in Nantambu, 
we recognize that left-handed people are skilled at undoing 
spells. One student of mine is terrified of butterflies, even 
though he considers it ridiculous. Yet in exchange for this 
fear of fluttering whimsy, he has one of the most orderly 
minds for games and strategy that I have ever seen.
“Sometimes, we do not understand our magic, and 
that lack of understanding causes pain. People who 
are uncomfortable in their own skin are incredible 
shapechangers but often feel unsettled until they recognize 
the shape they were meant to be. Those who feel an urge 
to jump from high places often become frightened of 
themselves, but they are simply channeling the untrained 
will to fly. 
“Sometimes, our talents are not revealed by happy 
means,” Teacher Ot face becomes somber, and he continues, 
“One student here had a family who planned her life out 
from birth to death, punishing her when she deviated the 
slightest bit. She only found freedom in the thought of 
her grave, and as a result, the dead began to speak to her. 
Here, she has freedom to choose her own path, but her 
necromancy remains strong. 
“You don’t have to share, but I want you to ask 
yourselves: what about you defines you, even if others 
rarely notice it? Is there something inside you that pulls at 
you, perhaps defying rational explanation? Thus, I return 
to my first question: who are you, and how can that person 
best be guided to grow?”
Once each student has either answered this final 
question or promised to think on it, Takulu hands 
each of them a yellow and blue bead made of durable 
glass. He tells them that they’re expected to wear a 
string of beads at all times to identify them as initiates 
of the Magaambya (both to let people know they 
represent the school as well as to identify them as 
initiates should they cause trouble). He asks each hero 
to incorporate this bead in their string, as it shows 
his role as the teacher who has admitted them. If they 
don’t yet have a string of beads—or even know about 
this requirement—he explains it to them and then asks 
them to start their string with the bead he’s given them.
The group interview complete, Takulu directs the 
heroes to Spire Dormitory, where they’ll stay while 
they’re students at the Magaambya.
XP Award:  After the completion of the initial 
interview, grant the heroes 80 XP.
INSECTILE HEROES
Some characters might be insectile or arachnid 
in form or outlook (such as anadi characters) and 
are thus drawn by the Vesicant Egg as well. These 
characters don’t have any particular insight into 
what has drawn them here any more than mundane 
insects do, and they aren’t drawn to any specific 
place on campus just yet. They only know that the 
Magaambya feels very much like the right place and 
that they belong on campus—a feeling that many 
students over the years have shared!

Spire Dormitory
With their interviews completed, the heroes can now 
freely explore the campus at their leisure, though the 
pouring rain discourages them from wandering far. 
The map of the Magaambya grounds appears on the 
inside front cover of this adventure. The obvious place 
for the heroes to shelter and unpack is their assigned 
student dorm building, the Spire Dormitory. This 
building already houses several fellow initiates who 
have been informed of the heroes’ impending arrival. 
When the heroes reach the dorm, Esi Djana (page 68) 
approaches to help the new initiates get settled in. Esi 
is an ambitious young woman who has already made 
a name for herself at the Magaambya. She carries a 
number of spider ‑silk umbrellas in case any of the 
heroes don’t have protection from the rain and need 
it. Read or paraphrase the following.
A young woman trots out from the one-story dormitory 
building, Shielding her head with a silk umbrella reinforced 
with dry reeds. Four stone spires surround and rise above the 
building. “You’re the new students, o? You’ll be rooming with 
us in Spire Dorm. Come in, I’ll show you the place.” The woman 
gestures with her umbrella toward the door, taking a few 
steps back toward the building’s welcoming, dry overhang.
A catfolk sprawls beneath the eaves of the dormitory 
building, a sliced and sticky mango laying on a cloth on his 
chest. He looks up from licking the juice off his fingers, his 
mouth spreading into a toothy smile. “Care for some mango?” 
he says cheerfully while gesturing idly to the fruit. “Or if you’d 
prefer something to cheer you up from the rain, I have some 
wine brewing back in my room.”
“Don’t offer them your moonshine!” Esi scolds, before 
addressing the heroes again. “This is Chizire. Don’t become a 
slacker like him.”
“I don’t need to study. Amurruns have the best magic, 
everyone says so,” Chizire says. “Esi here is trying to run the 
entire school. Even playing teacher for the new students, it 
looks like.”
Esi blows out a sharp breath. “Koride told me to get them 
settled. Said that handling the new students was our job.”
“Fft. Do we look like attendants to her? Not yet, we aren’t,” 
Chizire replies, turning his attention back to peeling the skin 
off another slice of mango. Esi waits for a moment before 
scuffing her foot at the catfolk’s tail and then stepping over 
him to go inside.

As Esi shows the heroes around Spire Dormitory, 
she also notes that in addition to sharing living space, 
the heroes have been chosen to become a “cohort.” 
Cohorts at the Magaambya are initiate groups that 
shares the same class schedule and Perquisite work 
schedule. These groups rotate duties with other 
cohorts to ensure each cohort gets a specific day of the 
week off from their work. 
In addition to Chizire and Esi, Ignaci Canterells and 
Anchor Root currently occupy the dorm. The other 
students living here are currently elsewhere. 
Ignaci greets the heroes with a charming manner 
that seems as polished and rehearsed as his smile. As 
soon as it’s polite to do so in conversation, he mentions 
that he sells alchemical items for a “reasonable fee to 
recoup his time and expenses.” He also mentions that 
the dorm holds a weekly game night that the heroes 
are welcome to attend.
Anchor Root is currently trying to clear out a 
mundane infestation of ants (which, unbeknownst 
to the students, have been attracted by the Vesicant 
Egg). She’s leading her fluffy chicken familiar around 
by a stick, and the chicken eagerly gobbles up the ants. 
The gnoll squeaks in horror when spotted and tries 
to avoid notice by hiding—poorly—behind a piece of 
furniture. Friendly heroes can wrest a few soft‑voiced 
responses from her and possibly even convince her to 
show off her collection of pet fruit beetles.
FEATURES OF SPIRE DORMITORY
Spire Dormitory is an open, airy building with several 
comfortable couches and beautiful mosaics. Four tall 
spires surround the building, two to the north and 
two to the south. At 50 feet high, these spires stand 
much taller than the single‑story dormitory. Open 
construction allows ample light during daylight hours, 
and lanterns hang in each room to provide light at night. 
Ceilings are 10 feet tall throughout, and the sturdy 
wooden doors latch from the inside (some students 
have, at their expense, installed locks). Each dorm 
room has mosaic floors and a university‑provided bed, 
couch, and chest. Some chambers originally served 
different purposes and were only later converted into 
residences, so some rooms are larger than others; this 
discrepancy is a point of minor contention between 
the students in residence. 
A1. SOARING SPIRE 
This spire looks identical to the other three around 
the dormitory: a narrow pillar of stone that tapers to 
a blunt point 50 feet above the ground. However, a 
strange gravitational anomaly surrounds this spire. A 
creature within 15 feet of the spire can High Jump up 
to 60 feet into the air without an Athletics check and 
land without falling damage. Magaambyan students 
mostly use this zone to slingshot each other into the air 
for fun or to access the sloped roof of the dormitory 
for some privacy. Unsurprisingly, Haibram uses it as a 
launching point for hang gliding and tries to fly as far 
as he can.
A2. COMMON ROOM 
Decorated with a colorful and intricate mosaic on 
the walls and floors, this large room has a number of 
plush couches for students to relax, socialize with one 
another, or simply take a quick nap.
MEET YOUR PEERS
The heroes are hardly the only up-and-coming 
students at the Magaambya. Kindled Magic outlines 
nine NPC students who are interwoven throughout 
this Adventure Path as peers and colleagues of the 
heroes, beginning on page 67. As they’re meant to 
grow alongside and remain relatively on par with the 
heroes during the Adventure Path, they don’t have 
any listed statistics beyond the skills they know 
best. Though these characters are meant to take an 
auxiliary role to the heroes’ actions, they’re valuable 
for creating a sense of immersion and community. 
At your discretion, feel free to add more students or 
even replace these students with different NPCs.
Befriending Students: The heroes will probably 
want to make friends with at least some of these 
NPCs. As noted on page 246 of the Pathfinder 
Core Rulebook , the use of the Diplomacy skill to 
change an NPC’s attitude only lasts for the current 
social interaction unless the GM decides otherwise. 
It’s up to you to decide when an NPC student’s 
attitude permanently shifts in favor of the heroes. 
Befriending these NPCs earns the heroes classroom 
benefits and access to uncommon rules items, as 
described on page 67.
Handling NPCs: Running the many teachers and 
students of the Magaambya can prove a difficult 
task for even the most prepared GM. Depending 
on the experience and willingness of you and 
your roleplaying group, you can consider allowing 
your players to roleplay specific student NPCs in 
addition to their own characters—this approach 
might be more challenging for the players but has 
the benefit of making the NPCs more robust. You 
can even reward Hero Points for occasions when a 
player-run NPC acts in character, but in a way that 
inconveniences the heroes.

A3. WEST BATH 
Magic keeps the water in this large bath fresh and 
warm. The antechamber to the south serves as a 
washing and changing room but has informally turned 
into a laundry. There are just about always piles of 
laundry stacked here. 
Anyone searching this area who succeeds at a DC 20 
Perception check finds a loose stone concealing three 
dishes of a strange red mold. Chizire keeps this mold 
here, and he’s the only one aware of its presence. The 
mold is harmless, but it causes a creature who ingests 
a dish of it to display fever symptoms, including 
bloodshot eyes and yellowed skin, for 24 hours. A 
hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Nature check to Recall 
Knowledge identifies the effects of the mold; on a 
critical failure, the hero thinks the mold is poisonous. 
Chizire uses the mold to fake illness whenever he has 
an obligation he doesn’t feel like doing.
A4. WASHROOMS 
The dorm has two major washrooms that each contain 
toilets, mirrors, and washbasins for the students to 
freshen up. 
A5. ANCHOR ROOT’S ROOM 
Anchor Root’s room is mostly neat, save for the 
occasional dried chicken dropping. Stacks of small, 
cleaned animal bones sit in the corners, and several 
large tubs serve as homes to her collection of pet fruit 
beetles, many of which are the size of a human fist.
A6. ESI’S ROOM 
This room is crammed to the brim with hiking and 
sports sticks, cut pieces of leather, carving supplies, 
book glue, parchment, stray books, and half‑done 
sewing projects. Despite this quality, Esi occasionally 
comments on the strangeness of having such a large 
room to herself and how it often feels empty. 
A7 . OKORO’S ROOM 
Games of all kinds, from wooden board games to dart 
boards and hoops, have been piled high in this room. 
Everything appears impeccably organized with not 
even a speck of dust or mud on anything.
A8. CHIZIRE’S ROOM 
This room most notably features a fully functional 
moonshine still. Chizire happily shares his recent 
brewing projects with anyone who happens to pass by, 
regardless of whether they’re interested. Despite this 
contraption taking up most of his room’s free space, 
Chizire also keeps a few shade‑loving plants from 
Kibwe in pots. 
A9. MARIAMA’S ROOM 
This room formerly belonged to Haibram, but the 
dwarf wagered it in a high‑stakes card game against 
Mariama and lost. Mariama’s room is filled with 
wooden practice weapons, old scrolls, impressive 
but magically inert knickknacks, and a stuffed lizard 
toy. The room also smells heavily of narcotics. Her 
familiar, a fat monitor lizard named Kedu, is usually 
asleep near the window.
A10. TZENIWE’S ROOM 
Due to her two children, Tzeniwe received the largest 
dorm room, which the other residents have grudgingly 
admitted is fair and thus off‑limits from various student 
gambits. As one might expect from the presence of 
two rambunctious spiderlings, the room looks messy 
with toys, webs, and weaving projects stuck to various 
walls and the ceiling. 
A11. IGNACI’S ROOM 
Glass alchemy equipment primarily occupies the room, 
scattered across the extra chest, desk, and bookshelf 
that Ignaci misappropriated from elsewhere on 
campus. Ignaci sells common alchemical elixirs of 3rd 
level or less and alchemical tools of 4th level or less; he 
has a one in four chance of having something specific 
the heroes ask about right on hand. If he makes bombs 
or poisons, he certainly doesn’t admit to it.
A12. HAIBRAM’S ROOM 
After losing his large room to Mariama in a card 
game, Haibram remained true to his word and moved 
into this smaller chamber—clearly, he’s more sore 
about losing than about the smaller accommodations. 
Haibram has an impressive collection of weapons, 
both real and fake, but his most impressive possession 
is a pair of cloth and reed dragon wings big enough 
for flight.
A13. NOXOLO’S ROOM 
This room contains a large collection of dance outfits, 
several small chests of medical supplies, and a tall jug 
of water Noxolo keeps on hand as an emergency fire 
extinguisher. Almost all of the room’s furniture and 
her possessions have been crammed against the walls 
of the room, leaving a large amount of clear floor 
space at the center for dancing.
A14. AVAILABLE ROOMS 
There are six rooms available from which the 
heroes can choose. Each is neatly made and ready 
for someone to move into it. Upon each bed, the 
heroes find a scrap of yellow cloth folded around a

A15. EAST BATH  LOW 1
Kept slightly cooler than the west bath, this large bath 
sees less use from the residents, as does the laundry 
room to the south. The east bath has a few heaps of 
clothes that have been here for months but which no 
one has claimed.
Creatures: The ambient magic of the Magaambya, 
and of this area in particular, has animated two 
scraps of cloth as spellskeins. The spellskeins don’t 
bother the dorm’s residents, instead hiding in wicker 
baskets, under the wash bin, or in cracks in the wall. 
As a result, the residents don’t even know of their 
presence. The spellskeins are nevertheless protective 
of the students, and when a hero comes into this area 
for the first time, the spellskeins mistake them for an 
intruder and hop out in frog shape to attack. They 
enthusiastically attack but break off combat quickly. 
Any spellskein reduced to fewer than 6 Hit Points, 
or which becomes grabbed, ceases its attacks. The 
heroes can drive these spellskeins out of the dorm, but 
once the tiny constructs accept the heroes as proper 
residents, they’re harmless, other than stealing the 
occasional unattended kerchief or sash.

Treasure: The heroes can find a +1 handwraps of 
mighty blows  among the abandoned laundry here. 
None of the other students have claimed it, so the 
heroes can keep it if they’d like.
A16. ALL-SEEING SOLUTIONS
This well‑rendered drawing of the black‑and‑white 
mask of Nethys, god of magic, adorns the wall 
at the end of the hall. The words “All‑Seeing 
Solutions: Pay in Light, Let the Darkness 
Show Wisdom!” is inked onto the wall next 
to the mask. Ignaci built a magical machine 
behind the mask, just visible behind the 
mask’s eyes. A hero who succeeds at 
a DC 15 Arcana or Perception check 
while examining the mask spots it there. 
When someone places a silver piece into the slot 
of the white eye and holds a written assignment 
or question before the black eye, the mask’s 
mouth ejects a scrap of paper. This 
paper most often contains an insulting 
message (like “your penmanship leaves something 
to be desired.”) or gibberish (like “needs more green 
curry!”), but Ignaci put a bit more magic into this 
prank project than expected: one out of 10 times, the 
scrap of paper provides a genuinely helpful clue to 
completing the assignment. A mask only spits out a 
response to a particular assignment or question once. 
Perplexed students desperate to finish an assignment 
sometimes rely on the All‑Seeing Solutions when they 
have no other choice. Ignaci removes the money and 
changes the paper every week or so. 
A17 . MAINTENANCE HATCH
The secret door to this hallway is well‑hidden, but 
marks on the floor and the wall nearby give away its 
frequent use. A hero looking around this area finds the 
secret door with a successful DC 16 Perception check. 
A hatch at the end of the hall leads into a cramped 
maze of decommissioned water and delivery tunnels 
beneath the campus. The other students know about 
these tunnels and mostly use them for exploring, 
playing card games, or engaging in other private 
endeavors. Anyone in the tunnels can sometimes hear 
echoes of conversations from distant parts of the 
campus. If the heroes don’t discover this secret tunnel 
on their own, a student they’ve befriended might tell 
them about it. Where the tunnels might lead is up to 
you, but the heroes will learn that they lead to some 
storage rooms later in this chapter and, near the end 
of this adventure, that they connect to some dangerous 
insect‑invested caverns. 
A18. FROG POND 
Though various puddles and pools spring up all 
over campus during Nantambu’s rainy season, this 
deep pond remains all year round. While Mariama 
is convinced that the frogs in the pond are enchanted 
and deliberately jump on her, the frogs are entirely 
ordinary but attracted to the bright colors and unusual 
scents Mariama wears.

Around Campus
After the heroes have settled in at the Spire Dormitory, 
Esi offers to show them around the 
other two areas they’re most 
likely to frequent while living on 
campus: the dining hall and the 
student supply store. The latter 
is particularly important, as the 
heroes must go there to get their 
stipends for supplies and other 
living expenses. If the heroes balk 
at going back out into the rain, 
Esi replies with a laugh, “You had 
better get used to it, o! It rains like 
this over half the year.”
THE DINING HALL
The Magaambya’s dining hall is 
a large, kitchen‑warmed facility 
with handsome mosaics and 
plenty of seating. Though most students 
take their meals outside on sunny days, the 
hall is a very popular meeting place for students and 
teachers during the rainy season. Scholars soak up the 
warmth, chat with each other, and casually eat slices of 
mango or plantains from wide, shallow baskets. 
The head cook, Lumusi Yao (NG female human 
chef 5), makes a point of coming out to greet new 
students and welcoming them to the dining hall, 
which she considers her domain. She notes that the 
students receive two meals every day and that the 
dining hall is open from sunrise until two hours after 
sunset each day. Although most workers in the dining 
hall know students by sight, Lumusi gives each of 
them a glass bead resembling a piece of fruit to mark 
their status. She encourages them to wear it along 
with their other beads.
If the conversation gets around to money‑making 
opportunities, Lumusi mentions that she uses students 
to help the constantly overworked kitchen staff. 
Students can use the Earn Income downtime action 
(Core Rulebook  236) to harvest nearby jungle fruit 
(using Survival), help tend the community gardens 
(using Nature), repair serving dishes or kitchen 
implements (Crafting), or use other relevant skills. 
Lumusi typically has students conduct level 1 tasks, but 
at your discretion, she might have more challenging 
opportunities available.
STUDENT SUPPLY STORE
Affectionately named “the Powderpile” due to its 
large collection of magical powders, the student 
supply store is run by a diligent kobold named 
Xhokan (LN male kobold inventory manager 9). 
Xhokan gives each new student who comes to the 
store a small lump of clay and demands they 
roll it into a bead and then return it to 
him for his collection. In exchange, the 
kobold gives each of them a tan glass 
bead in the shape of a bulging sack for 
them to wear with their other beads. 
More importantly, Xhokan gives 
each hero their initial stipend of 
40 gp and some basic supplies, such as 
parchment, quills, and ink. He explains 
that, so long as they’re students in good 
standing, they receive basic school supplies 
and 4 gp at the start of every month. He gives 
them their first 4 gp as well but bristles at 
any suggestion that he should’ve simply 
given a lump sum of 44 gp—to 
Xhokan’s keen mind, the amounts 
are separate and should be given 
and tracked separately. This initial 
stipend seems like a lot of money, but it’s the 
bulk of the party’s treasure for this chapter.
Xhokan’s store sells many common items the heroes 
might need: all adventuring gear; alchemical items, held 
items, and worn items up to 3rd level; oils, potions, 
scrolls, and wands up to 5th level; and staves up to 6th 
level. He can recommend merchants in Nantambu for 
other common items the heroes might want. Xhokan 
also notes that the store pays a finder’s fee for items of 
interest to the Magaambya, allowing the heroes to sell 
treasure they find to the school. His store opens two 
hours before lunch and closes at sunset. 
At your discretion, Xhokan can sell more dangerous 
or advanced supplies as the students continue their 
studies, which is most likely to occur when the heroes 
gain higher ranks in the Magaambya. Xhokan might 
give access to these items earlier if the students prove 
that they can manage such items safely. 
Service Projects
As part of the conditions of their acceptance into 
the Magaambya, the heroes are expected to perform 
their Perquisite, a period of public service to the 
school and to the people living around it. To help the 
heroes settle into these responsibilities, the academy 
asked the senior initiates in the heroes’ dorm to spend 
five days giving the heroes tasks for their Perquisite, 
then introduce the heroes to the Magaambya’s 
teachers on the sixth day so that the new initiates can 
start attending classes after a day of rest. Esi Djana 
suggested that the tasks for the Perquisites be used to 
help teach the heroes skills and magic important to 
Lumusi Yao

each of the Magaambya’s five branches: Rain‑Scribes, 
Tempest‑Sun Mages, Cascade Bearers, Emerald 
Boughs, and Uzunjati. The other initiates agreed, 
though with varying degrees of enthusiasm. 
The day after the heroes’ arrival, Esi tells them to 
meet her in front of the Spire Dormitory first thing in 
the morning.
Rain-Scribe 
Assignment
When the heroes arrive outside 
the dormitory the next day, Esi 
and Haibram Thodja are waiting 
to greet them. Read or paraphrase 
the following.
“Ah, the green shoots blossom in 
the rain,” a well-muscled and 
clean-shaven dwarven man 
calls out with a smile. He 
gives a friendly wave. “It was 
meant to be me and Root 
meeting you, but I guess not?”
“I swapped with Anchor Root,” Esi replies, brushing the 
point aside before addressing the new students. “Over the 
next five days, you’ll be helping with each of the school’s 
five branches. Haibram and Anchor Root seek to join the 
Rain-Scribes. It’s the branch that explores the world and 
helps other travelers make their way through uncertain 
territories. That means Rain-Scribes have to work well with 
both nature and people.”
Haibram continues, “We can really use your help. The 
Kafesi Market won’t deal with anyone they know is part of 
the Magaambya. Since you’re new, you should be able to 
get in without a problem. You’ll be looking for, er, chickens.
“Did you know there’s such a thing as endangered 
chickens? Of course, any chicken that comes too close 
to me is endangered,” Haibram grins. “A farmer outside 
of Nantambu, Bisola, said her family used to keep Ojofiri 
chickens. Said they could hatch anything, even a dragon 
egg! I don’t know about that, but she wants to raise Ojofiris 
again, so we’re going to get her some. Ojofiri eggs aren’t 
very hardy and the birds aren’t good layers, so they mostly 
got put in soup and now there’s hardly any left. Well, we 
caught wind that someone at Kafesi has a few chicks. Go 
and bring some back.”
 The pair describes Ojofiri chickens as small fowl 
with white faces, dark blue feathers, and lavender 
combs; chicks should have dark blue feathers with 
a white underbelly. They ask the heroes to bring 
back at least four chicks, which hopefully will ensure 
there’s at least one male and one female chicken, 
but the more the better. They also describe the 
Kafesi Market as a wandering bazaar that clashed 
with the Magaambya in the past; its merchants are 
shrewd bargainers at best, and some are 
downright unscrupulous. The heroes 
should investigate sellers and their 
goods carefully before making a 
purchase. Esi gives the heroes a 
pouch with 20 gp and encourages 
them to hurry—the Ojofiri chicks 
might sell out.
Esi brushes off questions about 
why the Magaambya agents 
aren’t welcome there, but a hero 
who succeeds at a DC 15 Society 
check, or who later asks around 
and succeeds at a DC 17 Diplomacy 
check to Gather Information, 
learns that the Magaambya 
actually won’t deal with the 
Kafesi Market. Some of the 
market’s merchants have 
sold dangerous magical items 
and lethal curses—as a result, the Magaambya has 
informally boycotted them. With the heroes so new 
in their affiliation, they can visit the market without 
implicating the school as a whole. 
SEARCHING KAFESI MARKET
The heroes might not realize it right away, but they’re 
on a timer. The only chicken breeder with Ojofiri 
chicks, Makena (N female human chicken breeder), 
has only eight of them, and she sells one every hour. 
The heroes must learn the market’s current location, 
find the merchant, then barter for the chickens while 
she still has some left. The suggested skills for these 
tasks are listed below; as usual, other appropriate 
skills and Lore skills can be used instead of the given 
list, and you should allow players who come up with 
creative solutions to use different skills (but with a 
similar DC).
Finding the Vendors: Kafesi Market is a travelling 
market comprised of simple wooden tables that serve 
as stalls, sheltered under a cluster of large, colorful 
umbrellas. Heroes trying to find the market’s current 
location in Nantambu must succeed at a DC 19 
Diplomacy check to Gather Information (DC 15 if 
the heroes hide their initiate beads since people are 
reluctant to direct Magaambyans to the market) or a 
DC 19 Perception check to simply look around. If the 
heroes want to Aid one another on this check, the DC 
to Aid is 15. Finding the market takes 2 hours, or 1 
hour on a critical success.

On a success, the heroes find the location of the 
market and are directed to Makena. On a failure, the 
heroes find the location of the market but are referred 
to a different livestock merchant named Seydou (CN 
male human livestock merchant). On a critical failure, 
the heroes don’t learn the location of the market at all 
and must try again, taking more time.
The market is currently on the far west end of 
Nantambu. Reaching the market requires a soggy and 
cold half‑hour walk.
Bartering with Makena: Makena is a stern‑faced 
woman with her head shaved bald and huge hoop 
earrings through her ears. She’s willing to sell Ojofiri 
chicks to the heroes, but she’s a hard bargainer. Her 
current asking price is 4 gp per chick. The heroes can 
spend time negotiating to try to lower the price, though 
Makena sells a chick to another customer during each 
negotiation check, reducing the total number of chicks 
available by one. Bargaining requires a hero to attempt 
a DC 15 Deception, Diplomacy, or Intimidation check, 
or a DC 13 Mercantile Lore check. On a success, 
Makena lowers her price to 3 gp per chick; on a 
critical success, she lowers the price to 2 gp per chick. 
She provides no price reduction on a failure, but on a 
critical failure, she increases the price to 5 gp per chick 
out of stubbornness.
Bartering with Seydou: Seydou is a human man 
with a short, gray tunic and white‑blue paint all over 
his body. He doesn’t have any Ojofiri chicks but does 
have two chicks with grey‑black feathers and white 
underbellies that could pass as Ojofiri chickens to 
an uneducated eye. If asked about Ojofiri chickens, 
Seydou happily tries to sell the heroes both fakes for 
2 gp each. A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Nature or 
Perception check recognizes the trick. If they confront 
Seydou about this deception, the merchant laughs 
it off, claims it was a simple misunderstanding, and 
encourages them to look for another buyer if they’re 
going to be so picky. The heroes likely have to look 
elsewhere anyway since they need more chicks than 
what Seydou offers. Asking around uses the same 
process as described in Finding the Vendors, but the 
time is halved and the DCs are reduced by 2 since the 
heroes have already reached the market.
If the heroes purchase the fake chicks, Esi and 
Haibram accept them. Anchor Root knows at a glance 
that they’re not the right chicks, and she lets Esi and 
Haibram know in an indirect, non‑confrontational 
manner. Esi isn’t nearly so circumspect, and she 
informs the heroes in no uncertain terms that they 
should really be more wary of trickery in the future.
Shopping at Kafesi: Though the heroes have come 
here for chickens, nothing prevents them from shopping 
for other items. The market has common items of 5th 
level or less, including items Xhokan doesn’t carry at 
the Powderpile (such as weapons and armor). Doing 
other shopping generally takes 30 minutes.
Chicken Care: Any hero Trained in Nature or 
who succeeds at a DC 14 Medicine or Nature checks 
recognizes that baby chicks should be kept warm on 
the long, wet walk back to the Magaambya. Ojofiri 
chicks are especially fragile, and without special care 
during the damp and cold trek back to the academy, 
they’ll get sick enough to die. A hero must attempt a 
DC 15 Medicine or Nature check to keep the chicks 
warm and healthy. On a success, the chickens all make 
it back to the school just fine. On a failure, one chick 
gets sick and dies. On a critical failure, or if the heroes 
don’t ever realize that the chicks should be kept warm, 
two chicks get sick and die.
While Esi would prefer the heroes return any leftover 
money from the outing, neither she nor Haibram know 
how much the chicks cost, so the heroes can keep the 
change without consequences if they so choose.
XP Award: For each healthy Ojofiri chick the heroes 
bring back, award them 30 XP (up to 120 XP).

Tempest-Sun Mage Assignment
Esi asks the heroes to return to the same meeting spot 
the next day after breakfast for their next Perquisite 
task. When the heroes arrive, Esi awaits them. Read or 
paraphrase the following. 
“Morning, o!” Esi bobs her umbrella in greeting. “It’s 
only me today, I’m the only one of us who plans to join 
the Tempest-Sun Mages. That’s the branch that defends 
Nantambu and the people around the city from outside 
threats, big and small. Today, you’re going to help us with 
a very small threat. Some gremlins have gotten into one 
of the school’s storage rooms. I want you to get them out 
without harming them.
“I mean it,” Esi adds with emphasis. “They’re sour little 
pests, but they haven’t done anything except throw some 
jars around and be obnoxious. The Magaambya doesn’t 
approve of killing anyone just because of who they are. 
A student was even expelled because of it, back before I 
came here.
“Between you and me, I don’t think anyone will mind 
much if you gave one or two a whack to the head, but get 
them out of the storage room and release them off the 
grounds—really, it’s probably best to release them outside 
of Nantambu entirely.” 
The expelled student that Esi mentions is Uduak 
Basni, a young man who suffered a terrible fate after 
violently protesting his punishment and wound up as 
Stone Ghost (page 88). Though the latter fact remains 
unknown to the members of the Magaambya, heroes 
who investigate the matter of gremlin attacks at the 
academy learn about Uduak’s story up until the time 
of his (presumed) death. Esi only knows the broadest 
strokes of the incident but can suggest that curious 
heroes ask a teacher or look into the school records 
after they’ve finished their assignments. 
Esi isn’t entirely clear on the distinction between 
gremlin types, but she has been told that these 
gremlins are called pugwampis. Heroes who succeed 
at a DC 14 Nature check (or a DC 12 Gremlin Lore 
or similar Lore check) to Recall Knowledge remember 
that pugwampi gremlins are fey creatures that cause 
misfortune to nearby creatures; a hero also recalls 
that pugwampis have an obsessive love of gnolls. On 
a critical success, the hero remembers that gremlins 
have an aversion to small bells made of semiprecious 
metal. Xhokan sells small silver bells at the student 
supply store for 5 sp, but he loans them at no charge 
if told that the heroes need them for an assignment. If 
the heroes think to research the topic of pugwampis 
in a school library, the Recall Knowledge check takes 
1 hour but gains a +2 circumstance bonus. Looking in 
the library also reveals the tragic story of Uduak Basni.
The heroes might ask for Anchor Root’s help if they 
find out that pugwampis revere gnolls. While Anchor 
Root doesn’t feel comfortable refusing a reasonable 
request, she’s also scared to face gremlins. Enlisting her 
aid requires a PC to succeed at a DC 16 Diplomacy 
check. On a success, she comes along but doesn’t aid 
in any fight, and she retreats to her room immediately 
after the harrowing encounter. On a failure, or if the 
heroes attempt to Intimidate her or otherwise compel 
her with force, Anchor Root has a full‑fledged anxiety 
attack and becomes wholly unable to assist.
STORAGE BARN  SEVERE 1
The gremlin‑infested storage room is one of six rooms 
in a large storage barn on campus. The main door to 
the barn is open, but a broom handle stuck sideways 
through infested storage room’s door keeps it jammed 
shut. From the outside, the heroes can easily open the 
door, but the gremlins couldn’t get it open from the 
inside (and they haven’t bothered to try). The storage 
room is semi‑circular in shape with a 10‑foot‑high 
ceiling. The room has two sets of shelves, one 3 feet off 
the ground and one 7 feet off the ground. Though the 
room has no windows, a trio of sunrods have spilled 
out of a gnawed barrel, illuminating the chamber with 
bright light. Several broken jars litter the floor.
A secret hatch in the floor is normally difficult to 
spot, but the angle of light from the sunrods makes it 
easier than usual to notice. A hero searching the room 
who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception check sees the 
outline of the hatch. It leads to the maze of tunnels 
beneath the school, which is how the gremlins got into 
the barn. A hatch in the exterior wall of the nearby Star 
Dormitory provides the closest access to the surface, 
but the tunnels connect to the Spire Dormitory, too.
Creatures: Four pugwampis hide on the top shelves 
of the storage room. They were ordered to cause 
trouble by their boss, Kurshkin, and throw jars at 
anyone who enters the room (or just for the fun of it). 
GREMLIN BELLS
Some old tales indicate that gremlins fear and 
shun hanging bells of semiprecious metals, such as 
silver or gold. Although most bells lack any genuine 
gremlin-repelling power, most gremlins believe this 
superstition and avoid strings of valuable-looking 
bells. The heroes don’t know it yet, but they’ll 
soon have an opportunity to enchant bells to repel 
gremlins and other nefarious fey—and, later, they’ll 
put their magical defenses to use!

As Esi noted, the gremlins don’t aim to permanently 
injure anyone and mainly seek to break things while 
simultaneously upsetting people. The pugwampis 
throw anything within reach at the heroes, then 
hide behind the clutter of the top shelves to avoid 
any repercussions. However, if attacked with lethal 
damage, the gremlins fight to kill in self‑defense.
Any pugwampi reduced to fewer than 6 Hit Points 
tries to escape through the hatch in the floor and flees 
the campus grounds as quickly as possible. 
Nonlethal Attacks:  The heroes can simply beat 
the pugwampis into unconsciousness with nonlethal 
attacks and remove them from the campus. 
Scare Them Out: These pugwampis have an almost 
pathological fear of metal bells. They avoid attacking 
anyone holding metal bells; if all the heroes do so, the 
gremlins don’t attack at all. Any hero holding metal 
bells gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Intimidation 
checks against them. A pugwampi that is Demoralized 
from someone holding bells can’t reduce its frightened 
condition as long as it can see the person holding the 
bells, and it’s fleeing for as long as it’s frightened (and 
likely just keeps running, even if it recovers).
Anchor Root’s Help: Another solution involves asking 
Anchor Root to convince the pugwampis to leave. The 
pugwampis only speak Gnoll and Undercommon, and 
since Anchor Root speaks Gnoll, she can communicate 
with them. When she starts talking, it becomes clear that 
the pugwampis give her a lot of deference; unless they’re 
in combat, they sit at her feet and listen attentively 
to what she says. Getting Anchor Root to lead the 
pugwampis away is as easy as letting her know which 
way to go. Once she has led them where the heroes want, 
she commands them to disperse and cause no more 
trouble. They scatter immediately, but being gremlins, 
they’re unlikely to refrain from mischief for long.
Should the heroes interrogate a pugwampi (after 
arranging a way to communicate with it), the gremlin 
admits there’s more going on. The gremlins work for 
a tougher gremlin named Kurshkin, and Kurshkin 
works for a scary ghost. The pugwampis don’t know 
much beyond that, but they insist that both Kurshkin 
and Kurshkin’s boss are “up to something, and it won’t 
be good for the stuck‑up wizards.”
PUGWAMPIS (4) CREATURE 0
Pathfinder Bestiary 193
Initiative Perception +6
Ranged [one-action] thrown bottle +6 (nonlethal, range increment 
10 feet), Damage 1d6 bludgeoning
Losing the Fight:  If the heroes find themselves 
overwhelmed by the gremlins, they can return 
to Esi (or to anyone else on campus) and admit 
defeat without consequence. Esi can gather a more 
experienced group of initiates to deal with the 
gremlins instead.
XP Award: If the heroes remove the gremlins from 
campus without resorting to violence, award them XP 
as though they had defeated the gremlins in combat. 
If the heroes learn about Kurshkin from the gremlins, 
award them an additional 30 XP. 
Cascade Bearer Assignment 
The next day, Anchor Root, Mariama Keitana, 
and Chizire wait at the usual meeting spot. Read or 
paraphrase the following.
Three figures wait in front of the dorms, though one 
has curled up on a blanket in a miraculously dry spot 
and seems half asleep. Mariama observes the drowsing 
catfolk with detached interest before turning to raise a 
hand in greeting. “From an objective standpoint, it’s really 
impressive how he can sleep anywhere. Anyway, we’re 
Cascade Bearers. Or at least, I am, and Anchor Root is 
filling in because Chizire is... Chizire. Cascade Bearers 
advance magical theory. It’s also our job to make new 
magic safe for everyone to use, so we don’t have a repeat 
of the exploding nose incident. We don’t talk about the 
exploding nose incident. 
“Since you’ve shown us there are gremlins around, we’re 
going to do some sparkly finger wiggles to help deal with 
that. We need some special oils to do the ritual, though. 
Anchor Root’s here to tell you what to get.”
The small gnoll squeaks and flinches as attention turns 
to her. “U-um... we need scarlet cap oil, bone oil, and...” 
Anchor Root whimpers and fidgets her paws together. 
“C-caterpillar oil. But they need to be the right... u-um, I’ll 
just show you.”
“If you have trouble making the oil, come back here and 
I’ll wake Chizire up. He’s good at brewing,” Mariama adds. 
“Be done in eight hours, or you’ll miss dinner. And try to 
have fun!”
Anchor Root explains that the heroes must recover 
bones to render into bone oil, a specific type of red 
mushroom growing outside the city, and several fuzzy 
caterpillars found in the nearby jungle. Anchor Root 
nervously glosses over the fact that the caterpillars 
must also be rendered into oil. She fidgets when 
asked questions, and any attempts to reassure or give 
pep‑talk to the gnoll seem to make her shrink even 
further into her shell. 
As noted, Mariama expects the heroes to acquire all 
three oils and complete a ritual under her direction 
within 8 hours.

THAT’S GOING ON YOUR PERMANENT RECORD
As students at a prestigious magical university, 
the heroes have options that heroes of other 
Adventure Paths don’t have, including running to 
the teachers for help if a situation seems too difficult 
or dangerous. The exchange for this additional 
protection is additional responsibilities; wandering 
adventuring bands often escape accountability 
for their misdeeds, but the Magaambya will hold 
students to account. Gross violations of law or other 
misconduct, like assault or grave robbing, might see 
a student heavily punished or even expelled. These 
social consequences help make up for the relative 
lack of danger that the heroes face during this early 
section of the Adventure Path.
BONE OIL
Anchor Root tells the heroes she needs “lucky bones,” 
but she can’t describe how she knows which bones 
are lucky and which aren’t; heroes with targeted 
divination spells such as object reading  ( Advanced 
Player’s Guide 222) can identify bones as lucky or not. 
Anchor Root suggests that the heroes simply bring her 
a large assortment of bones and let her pick out the 
lucky ones. There are several avenues the heroes might 
pursue to get a collection of bones.
The most straightforward source of bones is a 
local butcher. Nantambu’s butchers normally save 
meat bones to make broth. Out of respect for the 
Magaambya, a butcher gives leftover bones to the 
heroes for free, so long as the heroes wait an hour 
for the butcher to get some free time to bag them up. 
Heroes willing to pay 1 gp for a butcher’s time can get 
the bones immediately.
Finding about other sources of bones in 
Nantambu—“lucky” or not—requires an hour of time 
and a successful DC 10 Diplomacy check to Gather 
Information. A successful check points the heroes to 
stinking garbage heaps where they can find bones 
available for those who don’t mind getting dirty. On 
a critical success, the heroes hear about a cow carcass 
just outside of town. According to rumor, a farmer 
brought the cow to market along the crowded road 
when the cow stood stock still, uttered the words, “A 
market in the city? Death would be better!” and died 
on the spot. No one has bothered to take care of the 
unusual cow’s remains just yet. The rumor isn’t true; 
the cow died naturally, albeit suddenly. Its bones are 
fresh and so “lucky” that they grant a +2 circumstance 
bonus to checks to prepare the bone oil.
While the heroes could, in theory, dig up bones from 
a local graveyard, this course of action carries so many 
risks and so little benefit that it’s outside the scope of 
this adventure.
Making Oil: Once the heroes have returned with the 
bones and Anchor Root has selected the correct ones 
to use, the heroes must carbonize the bones by burning 
them before using the sludgy remains to make the 
bone oil. A hero can take 1 hour to craft the oil with 
a successful DC 17 Crafting or Nature check. Failure 
means the hero doesn’t extract the oil but retains the 
ingredients to try again, and a critical failure ruins the 
bones entirely. 
If none of the heroes have confidence in their skills 
to craft the bone oil, Mariama puts slugs on Chizire’s 
face until he wakes up and then forces the catfolk 
to make the bone oil instead. Chizire automatically 
succeeds at crafting the oil, but he takes 2 hours 
instead of 1 hour to do so.
SCARLET CAP OIL  MODERATE 1
Anchor Root shows the heroes a cluster of dried, red, 
cup‑shaped mushrooms to help them properly identify 
the correct fungus. She describes the area of the jungle 
where she found the fungi and suggests that the heroes 
could find fresh mushrooms there (as they can’t use 
the dried mushrooms to make the oil). Fortunately, 
the scarlet cap mushrooms don’t look like any kind 
of poisonous mushrooms in the area, meaning the 
heroes likely won’t make a fatal miscategorization, 
but she needs mushrooms that have received a lot of 
sunlight and moonlight, which means harvesting the 
mushrooms growing high on a jungle tree. Anchor 
Root also adds, “Redridge mother calls them tree 
blood” before flinching and apologizing. 
Though the scarlet caps are relatively uncommon, 
they grow in the area where Anchor Root described, 
about 1 hour outside of Nantambu. A tree covered 
with mushrooms as high as 20 feet up its trunk stands 
in the middle of its clearing. Several wide leaves droop 
down from the top of the tree. A hero can climb it with 
a successful DC 10 Athletics check. 
Creature: A malevolent myceloid named Umbo 
hides in the leaves above the mushrooms. Umbo was 
kicked out of his colony for selfishness and cruelty 
even beyond what the myceloids considered tolerable. 
He has kept watch over this clearing, hoping to 
ambush travelers, and the heroes provide an excellent 
opportunity. He tries to stay hidden in the leaves until 
he sees what the heroes are up to. Once he realizes 
that one of them is climbing the tree he’s in, he attacks. 
For his first action, he grabs one of the large leaves 
and puts all his weight on it; the leaf bends nearly to 
the ground, deposits him to a space that he chooses 
anywhere adjacent to the tree trunk, then breaks off

(doing so uses a single Interact action with the move 
trait). He then uses his Emit Spores ability to inflict 
as many of the heroes as possible with purple pox. 
Umbo has no interest in negotiation, as he only wants 
to feast on a meal of humanoid flesh, but he flees into 
the jungle if reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points.

has already used the ability that day.
Speed 20 feet
Melee [one-action] fist +11, Damage  1d8+3 bludgeoning plus 
purple pox
Emit Spores [one-action] Frequency once per day; Effect Umbo 
expels spores in a 10-foot burst centered on a corner 
of his own space. This cloud lasts until the start of the 
myceloid’s next turn. Each creature that is in the cloud 
or enters it is exposed to purple pox.
Purple Pox (disease) Myceloids are immune; Saving Throw 
DC 18 Fortitude; Onset 1 minute; Stage 1  1d6 poison 
damage and stupefied 1 (1 day); Stage 2  4d6 poison 
damage, stupefied 3, and the creature is compelled to 
seek out the nearest myceloid colony—this compulsion 
is a mental emotion effect (1 day); Stage 3 The creature 
dies. Over 24 hours, its corpse becomes bloated and 
bursts, releasing a new, fully grown myceloid.
Spore Domination  [two-actions] (emotion, enchantment, 
incapacitation, mental, primal) Umbo targets one 
creature affected by purple pox within 30 feet. That 
creature must attempt a DC 18 Will save. It is then 
temporarily immune to spore domination for 10 minutes.
Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success Until the end of its next turn, the target is 
helpful to myceloids and can’t take hostile actions 
against them. If attacked by Umbo, the target is freed 
from this effect at the end of Umbo’s turn.
Failure As success, but for 1 minute.
Critical Failure  As success, but until the purple pox 
is cured.
Treasure: Umbo has stashed a few treasures from 
past victims inside a crook in the tree. This cache is 
well‑concealed from the ground, requiring a hero to 
succeed at a DC 25 Perception check to spot it from 
there, but anyone climbing up to harvest the mushrooms 
automatically spots the following items: a holly bush 
feather token, a wolf fang, and a hand of the mage.
Making Oil: Pressing the oil from the scarlet caps 
is simple and requires no check, but it does require 
gradual squeezing that takes 1 hour. Canny heroes 
might think to press the mushrooms while they walk 
back to the city to save time.
CATERPILLAR OIL
Anchor Root cautiously shows off a pet caterpillar of 
hers as an example of what the heroes should look 
for: a colorful larva with fuzzy tufts. Anchor Root’s 
caterpillar sits placidly on a branch in a tub in her 
room. She warns the heroes that the fuzzy‑looking 
caterpillars are extremely painful to touch and must 
be collected very carefully. She also shamefully 
admits that she can’t bear to watch the heroes kill 
the caterpillars to make them into caterpillar oil. 
Troubling Anchor Root further over this fact causes 
her attitude to worsen; she spends the rest of the day 
crying uncontrollably. 
The caterpillars live in the jungle, but the heroes 
don’t need to go nearly as far from the city to find 
them as they did for the scarlet cap mushrooms. On

the other hand, the caterpillars aren’t as easy to find. 
After an hour of searching, the heroes can find some 
caterpillars with a successful DC 15 Nature or Survival 
check or a DC 20 Perception check. The heroes should 
collect the caterpillars without touching them, but 
any such method of collecting them will do. If the 
heroes invent a complicated method to capture the 
caterpillars, you can ask for a DC 15 Sleight of Hand 
or Thievery check, with failure meaning that the hero 
has inadvertently grabbed a caterpillar. A hero who 
touches a caterpillar more than just casually brushing 
against it must attempt a DC 13 Fortitude save or 
become sickened 1 from the pain and unable to reduce 
their sickened condition below 1 for 1 minute (or 1 
hour on a critical failure). This is a poison effect. 
Making Oil: Squashing the caterpillars into oil takes 
only a few minutes.
THE RITUAL
Once the heroes have returned to Spire Dormitory 
with all three types of oil, Mariama takes them and 
contributes a string of tiny bells made of cold iron. If 
the heroes failed to acquire all three oils, she scratches 
her head, opines that maybe the task was too advanced, 
and dismisses the heroes for the remainder of the day.
Once the three oils are prepared, Mariama explains 
the concept of gremlin bells, as described in the 
sidebar on page 19 (as well as in the sidebar on page 
192 of the Pathfinder Bestiary). If the heroes already 
know about gremlin bells, and especially if they used 
them against the pugwampis the previous day, she’s 
exuberant about the heroes’ practical knowledge and 
asks for details of that encounter.
Mariama notes that bells usually only work because 
the gremlins believe that bells ward them off. However, 
the Magaambya has been working on using gremlin 
bells to create a stronger magical ward and sees this 
task as an opportunity to test the bells. The first test 
area is the storage room from which the heroes ejected 
the pugwampis.
If no hero has the proficiency to act as the ritual’s 
primary caster, Mariama has Anchor Root do it. 
Mariama asks as many heroes who can serve as 
secondary casters to do so while other heroes watch. 
For more information on rituals, see page 408 of 
the Core Rulebook. As a 1st‑level ritual, fey abeyance 
has a DC of 21 for the primary caster and a DC of 16 
for the secondary casters.
FEY ABEYANCE RITUAL 1
RARE ABJURATION
Cast 1 hour; Cost rare oils, cold iron bells worth at least 5 
gp; Secondary Casters 1
Primary Check Nature (trained), Secondary Checks  
Crafting, Intimidation, Occultism, Performance
Area An enclosed area up to 60 feet × 60 feet, up to 20 
feet high
Duration 1 week
You ward an area with cold iron bells, protecting it from the 
influence of the first world. Fey creatures feel uncomfortable 
within the area and all physical attacks against them are 
considered cold iron for the purposes of their Weaknesses 
and Resistances. Furthermore, you set up bells within 3 
squares within the area (usually at entrances). When a 
fey creature begins its turn in a square containing bells, it 
takes mental damage equal to its Weakness to cold iron, if 
any. This damage is nonlethal.
Critical Success You may designate up to 6 squares to 
contain bells.
Success The ritual succeeds.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure  The ritual has no effect and attracts 
the attention of a troublesome fey creature. At the GM’s 
discretion, it might be hostile or merely mischievous.

After the heroes have attempted the ritual, whether it 
succeeds or fails, Mariama notes that the ritual has its 
potential uses but might have unintended consequences 
since it doesn’t target gremlins specifically and could 
injure any kind of fey, even benevolent ones. She 
dismisses the heroes until the following morning.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each type of 
oil they recover to a maximum of 90 XP. Give them 80 
XP for attempting the ritual, but increase this amount 
to 120 XP if the ritual succeeds. 
Emerald Boughs Assignment 
When the heroes arrive at the meeting place the 
next morning, Ignaci and Strands‑of‑Glowing‑Dawn 
Tzeniwe are there to meet them. Ignaci compliments 
any particularly well‑dressed or good‑looking heroes 
before explaining the next assignment. Read or 
paraphrase the following.
“Good morning,” Ignaci says with a smile. “As you’ve 
no doubt gathered, we’re here to task you with your 
assignment for the day. Our ever-thoughtful colleague 
Esi suggested that each of us petitioning to join the 
five different branches of the Magaambya take turns in 
requesting your assistance. Strands-of-Glowing-Dawn 
Tzeniwe and I are hoping to become a part of the Emerald 
Boughs. Our field of study is the world as it is. We study 
the communities, people, and events of the present day, 
if you will. There are some people who feel that simple 
observation and investigation makes us the Magaambya’s 
spies, but that misses the point entirely.
“Today, I’d like you to help us deliver the mail.” Ignaci 
produces a basket filled with letters and parcels. “It’s not 
a flashy task, but it’s vitally important to the members of 
the local communities. If you find you have time to listen, 
people are often very willing to share news with those 
engaged in crucial public service.”
Tzeniwe adds, “Many recipients are far outside 
Nantambu, so I have rented elephant birds for you to ride 
for the day.” She steps over to the large silk sacks bulging 
with food and odd-looking creams. “I have also packed you 
snacks for the trip, some hot coffee, spare umbrellas, dry 
towels, fresh socks, muscle balm—” She suddenly stops, 
pulling a toy elephant covered in sticky webs out of one of 
the bags. “Ugh, Zanvi! Sorry, one of my children was eager 
to help pack.”
The elephant birds roost nearby; each is a docile, 
flightless bird that’s Large in size and used to being 
ridden as a mount. There’s one for each hero. A hero 
can control the birds by their reins with no problems. 
Even characters who have never ridden one before get 
the hang of it quickly.
The basket contains two dozen letters and parcels, 
all jumbled together. Ignaci and Tzeniwe know they’re 
asking a lot from the heroes to sort all this mail out, 
but that’s the heroes’ task for the day—for as long as 
it takes.
NEITHER RAIN NOR HEAT NOR GLOOM OF NIGHT
The heroes can easily deliver most of the letters, most 
of which have clear addresses in or near Nantambu. 
As Ignaci observed, many recipients are happy to talk 
with the heroes about recent happenings in their lives. 
A woman named Chinasa is excited for her niece’s 
wedding and plans to sew the bride a gold embroidered 
dress, while a woman named Ige talks about her work 
rehabilitating injured jungle birds and releasing them 
back into the wild. Musubu introduces heroes to his 
newest puppy, who he found stuck up a tree, while a 
man named Jatau offers the heroes a jar of jam after 
having made too much. These easy deliveries take only 
2 hours.
Thirteen deliveries pose difficulties, as described 
below. The heroes might be out late making these 
deliveries, but recipients are generally happy to receive 
the mail at unusual hours. Recipients approached near 
their dinnertime sometimes offer a meal, so heroes out 
all evening might receive a lot of food.
Unclear Directions (5 letters):  Five letters have 
illegible addresses due to terrible handwriting. A hero 
must succeed at a DC 18 Society check to Decipher 
Writing to determine a letter’s intended recipient; on 
a failure, the hero can’t determine where to bring the 
letter. (Remember that Decipher Writing is a trained 
action.) Another method of making these deliveries 
involves asking around for help, which requires a hero 
to succeed at a DC 15 Diplomacy check to Gather 
Information. A hero can’t retry failures on these 
checks, as the correct address simply eludes them, but 
another hero can try instead. Delivering each letter 
takes half an hour.
Descriptive Addresses (4 parcels):  Rural areas 
far from the city don’t have standardized addresses. 
Instead, these parcels bear unhelpful directions in place 
of addresses, such as, “Chukwu who lives up the road 
from the creek,” or, in one particularly awful case, “You 
know Mubasu, his mother’s Inyene from Abwele, but 
he’s from the city, grew up in Ejosa, and moved when 
he got married. Lives with his in‑laws now, has many 
children and seven dogs and an ostrich and four cats 
which I told him will steal his baby’s breath, but he 
won’t listen. He has a shrine to Gozreh in front of his 
house, but half the wave’s head fell off and it looks 
like a lump now.” The best way to deliver these letters 
is to keep an eye out for relevant landmarks, which

requires a hero to succeed at a DC 15 Survival check. 
The heroes can Gather Information to deliver these 
packages, too, but the DC for the Diplomacy check is 
18. Again, heroes can’t retry failures on these checks. 
Delivering each parcel takes 1 hour.
Delivery Devilry (1 letter):  One letter turns out to 
be addressed to the heroes themselves—or, rather, 
to “Magaambyan Parcel Deliverers.” The letter 
inside describes how a previous group of initiates 
misdelivered a parcel a few weeks ago. The angry 
grandmother writing the letter eventually realized that 
the package never reached her granddaughter and is 
furious as a result. Should the heroes ask their fellow 
initiates, Tzeniwe tells them that fixing postal mistakes 
is part of the heroes’ duties for the day and that they 
should resolve the situation if they can.
The heroes can find the source of the issue—the 
parcel was delivered to the correct street but the 
wrong house. The resulting argument has already 
become the talk of the neighborhood. The person the 
parcel was intended for, Ndidi, obviously wants the 
parcel back. The woman who received the wrongly 
directed package, Jatia, argues that since the venerable 
Magaambya had given it to her, the package now 
belongs to her by right. The object of the argument 
is an incredible Mauxi stained glass lamp, which 
undoubtedly cost a lot of money to both purchase and 
to deliver intact.
Jatia is clearly proud of her unintentional gift and feels 
no shame at being accused of stealing it, so pleas to good 
nature or fairness to get her to return it—in other words, 
any uses of Diplomacy—have a DC of 26. A hero who 
succeeds at a DC 18 Deception check to Lie to Jatia (such 
as to convince her that the lamp is cursed or otherwise 
undesirable) convinces her to give it up. A hero can 
Coerce Jatia into giving up the lamp with a successful DC 
16 Intimidation check. However, such a tactic spawns 
complaints from neighbors, and the resulting backlash 
infuriates Ignaci and Tzeniwe and makes them less likely 
to befriend the heroes. If the heroes want to use magic 
or other trickery, you can use the statistics of a barkeep 
(Gamemastery Guide 238) for Jatia.
As a last‑ditch effort, a hero can attempt to sneak 
in and steal the lamp, although stealing from a 
townsperson shouldn’t be their first choice! A hero 
who succeeds at a DC 16 Stealth check surreptitiously 
retrieves the lamp. Failure means the hero is forced 
to flee Jatia’s house without the prize, while a critical 
failure means the heroes get caught and embroiled 
in legal trouble for the rest of the day. While Ignaci 
simply shrugs off legal entanglements with a smile, 
Tzeniwe is angry and unlikely to befriend the heroes, 
and the heroes can’t make any more deliveries.
Dealing with this misdelivered parcel takes 1 
hour, or even longer if the heroes spend a lot of 
time interacting with Jatia and Ndidi. If the heroes 
ultimately can’t resolve the issue, Ignaci and Tzeniwe 
are visibly disappointed, but they aren’t mad. 
Deific Missives (3 letters): Three letters are addressed 
to gods and include instructions on how to “deliver” 
them. The first such letter is addressed to Gozreh, 
deity of wind and weather, and requests that the letter 
be attached to a kite, flown high in the air, and then 
cut free. If the heroes don’t want to purchase a kite 
for 1 sp, they can craft one with a successful DC 14 
Crafting check. The rainy weather is very poor for 
kite flying, however; a hero must succeed at a DC 17 
Athletics or Sleight of Hand check to get the kite into 
the air. On a critical failure, the kite is destroyed in 
the endeavor—it’s torn in the sharp branches of a tree, 
struck by lightning, or meets some other similarly 
dramatic and destructive end. 
The second letter is addressed to Nethys and 
explains that five different spells must be cast upon the 
letter at once (within the same round). Fortunately, the 
letter‑writer has no qualms if the letter is destroyed in 
the process and in fact expects that result.
The final letter is to Mazludeh, empyreal lord 
of stewardship, community, and snakes. The 
instructions are that the enclosed message (a short 
request that a new canal wall be strong and reliable) 
must be transcribed onto an egg then fed to a snake; 
it further notes that the snake’s refusal to eat the 
egg is a bad omen. Fortunately, Nantambu’s shrine 
to Mazludeh has many quail eggs to inscribe and 
several egg‑eating snakes to act as divine messengers. 
Any hero asking around about this unusual delivery 
method is directed to the shrine and the friendly 
priests there. A recent community project resulted in 
a lot of prayers, so the shrine’s snakes, unfortunately 
for the heroes, aren’t very hungry today. A hero who 
succeeds at a DC 15 Nature check can find a snake 
that’s interested enough to take the egg, or a hero 
who succeeds at a DC 19 Thievery check can slip an 
egg into a full snake’s mouth (on a critical failure, the 
priests spot this behavior and eject the party from the 
shrine). A hero can also search the nearby jungle for 
a hungrier egg‑eating snake, but the rain means the 
snakes have taken shelter; a hero must succeed at a 
DC 23 Survival check to find one. 
Dealing with each divine letter takes 1 hour, or more 
if the heroes do a lot of shopping for the items needed 
to “deliver” them.
When the heroes have delivered all of the letters to 
the best of their abilities, Tzeniwe offers the party hot 
ginger beer to help shrug off the rain. Ignaci thanks the

heroes for their assistance and instructs them to return 
to the same meeting point tomorrow morning for their 
next assignment.
XP Award: Award the heroes 10 XP for completing 
each unclear or descriptive delivery (to a maximum 
of 90 XP). Award them 30 XP for resolving the 
misdelivered parcel and for “delivering” each deity 
missive (to a maximum of 120 XP).
Uzunjati Assignment 
When the heroes arrive for their last assignment of the 
week, they find Okoro and Noxolo waiting for them. 
Read or paraphrase the following.
An athletic young man waves enthusiastically from the 
pathway in front of the dormitory. Off to the side, on the 
mossy earth, a woman in a handsome dashiki sways and 
casually dances, snapping her fingers to an imaginary beat. 
A bizarre beast resembling a cross between a two-foot-long 
crocodile and a bear cub prances and nibbles at her ankles 
as she shuffles and snaps.
“Hi there!” the man says with a wide smile. “I’m Okoro, 
and this is Noxolo. We’re part of the Uzunjati! Well, not 
yet, but the tale of our becoming shall be a good tale to 
hear, someday. The Uzunjati tell stories to others and learn 
new stories in turn. Today, we want you to tell us the story 
of your past week so that we can learn it and pass it on 
to others. It is not only training for you in how to tell a 
story, but training for us in how to be good listeners. We 
all benefit!”
Okoro and Noxolo make it clear that they 
want a “story” about the heroes’ week, not a bare 
event‑by‑event recounting. The heroes can either tell 
individual stories of specific events during the week 
or collaborate to tell a story together. Part of the 
assignment is meant to gauge (both to the Uzunjati 
students and to you as the GM) what events interested 
or stood out to the players. Telling a skillful story might 
require a hero to succeed at a DC 15 Performance 
check, but you should allow for other relevant skills 
or even disregard the skill check entirely if the players 
are really engaged in the storytelling. 
While Okoro and Noxolo accept any tale the heroes 
wish to tell, if more than half of the characters fail the 
Performance check or refuse to take the assignment 
seriously, they consider the entire cohort to be a group 
of fools. This might impair potential friendships with 
either of them, but Okoro is likely a bit more forgiving.
Once the heroes finish, Noxolo has a follow‑up 
question for them: what is the moral of the collective 
story—that is, what lesson is the story trying to tell? 
The heroes can decide on morals independently or 
collectively, but the assignment isn’t complete without 
a moral. 
The Pending Ceremony: Once the heroes have told 
their tales and answered Noxolo’s question, Okoro 
and Noxolo both thank the heroes and let them know 
they have the rest of the day to themselves. Noxolo 
says that Teacher Ot wants the heroes to meet him at 
an outdoor ceremony stage erected on the grounds at 
dawn the next morning.
Teacher Ot didn’t say why, but Noxolo is pretty 
sure it’s for their cohort’s Introduction Ceremony. The 
Introduction Ceremony is something all new initiates 
go through; it’s where the teacher who admitted them 
to the school (in this case, Teacher Ot) presents them 
to other Magaambyan teachers. Okoro reminds the 
heroes to wear their beaded bracelets, and Noxolo 
suggests they dress nicely.
As the heroes have the rest of the day off, this time 
provides a good opportunity for interactions with 
the other students. It’s also fine to simply skip to the 
following morning. 
XP Award: For successfully sharing their stories, 
award the heroes 30 XP.

INTRODUCTION CEREMONY  SEVERE 1
Takulu Ot has requested to meet the heroes at dawn, 
a half hour before the ceremony is intended to begin. 
He planned to meet them early to walk through what’s 
expected of them, but he’s delayed at the last minute 
with other business. Takulu doesn’t consider this delay 
much of a problem, as the ceremony isn’t complicated 
and a half hour gives plenty of time. However, it means 
the heroes arrive alone at the site, where danger lurks.
When the heroes dispatched the pugwampis from 
the storage barn and erected the fey abeyance ritual 
there, the gremlin boss Kurshkin mistook these events 
as precursors to a new purge of gremlins from the 
campus. She had already decided to target the party, 
planning to kill a few heroes and embarrass the rest. 
Kurshkin overheard that the heroes were going to be 
honored at an outdoor stage, so she brought along 
a vexgit gremlin to sabotage the stage beforehand. 
When she arrives and sees the heroes coming early as 
well, she decides to just attack them and not bother 
with sabotage.
The ceremony stage is a simple platform decorated 
with intricate circular mosaics and a wide ramp 
descending to the grass. The wooden platform is 
elevated about 3 feet off the ground on sturdy wooden 
supports (the gremlins were going to wreck these 
supports, but they didn’t have time). Two 8‑foot‑tall 
pillars flank the ramp to the south, and a low, curved, 
stone wall to the north can provide audience seating.
Despite the sunny weather on the day of the 
ceremony, the ground is still very slick from the recent 
rains. The grass is difficult terrain. 
Snare: Although they haven’t yet gotten around to 
actual sabotage, Havvix created a hampering snare 
(Core Rulebook 590) in the dotted lines on the map. A 
hero must succeed at a DC 18 Perception check to spot 
the snare before it’s triggered. The gremlins are Tiny, 
and therefore don’t trigger the snare.
Creatures: Kurshkin lurks under the stage with a 
vexgit gremlin named Havvix. Havvix isn’t particularly 
loyal to Kurshkin—indeed, he’s not really loyal to 
anyone other than himself—but he’s itching for a fight. 
Havvix loves the sounds of broken bones and cries of 
pain. The two gremlins scamper up onto the stage to 
fight from what they consider the high ground once 
the heroes get close.
In a fight, Kurshkin prefers to stay close to her 
foes but out of melee range so that she can employ 
her Unluck Aura yet attack with her shortbow from 
a safe distance. She goads Havvix to rush into melee 
with as many of the heroes as he can. If pressed into 
melee, Kurshkin throws down her shortbow to draw 
her shortsword.
Kurshkin doesn’t fear bells at all; she’s far too old to 
be taken in by such superstitions. Havvix, however, is 
frightened 1 while within 30 feet of anyone displaying 
small metal bells. 
Havvix doesn’t retreat from a fight until reduced to 
fewer than 6 Hit Points. Kurshkin is more circumspect. 
She makes a tactical retreat if reduced to fewer than 16 
Hit Points. If reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points, she 
makes a false show of surrendering, only to cast spider 
sting when the heroes drop their guard. She then runs 
away. If Kurshkin escapes, the heroes might face her 
again in Chapter 3.

Gremlin Interrogation:  A captured gremlin 
immediately blames their leader, Stone Ghost, for the 
attack. Note that Havvix only speaks Undercommon, 
so Kurshkin is the most likely gremlin to give the 
heroes any information. They know almost nothing 
about the mysterious man beyond his ghostly nature, 
his familiarity with the grounds, and his demands for 
obedience. The only way they know to reach Stone 
Ghost is through winding tunnels that are nearly too 
small for a gremlin, making them much too small for 
anyone else. The tunnels twist and turn so much that 
they aren’t even sure where Stone Ghost’s chambers 
are. They gleefully boast that there are many more 
gremlins around the school than anyone realizes.
Teacher Ot Arrives: Whether the heroes are 
defeated, victorious, or simply ran away, Takulu Ot 
soon arrives and asks them what happened. He isn’t 
upset if the heroes killed the gremlins, as clearly they 
were defending themselves from a malicious ambush. 
If the heroes learned about Stone Ghost or that the 
school has even more gremlins, Takulu takes these 
reports seriously and resolves to look into them.
Takulu cancels the Introduction Ceremony due to 
the shock and concern caused by the gremlin attack. If 
the heroes hang around the area anyway, they can get 
quick introductions from a few of the teachers who 
come by to ask questions or congratulate the heroes 
for thwarting the gremlins, allowing them to meet, in 
advance, the three other teachers they’ll encounter in 
the next chapter.
XP Award: If the heroes learn about Stone Ghost, 
award them an additional 30 XP.

When the world was still young and there were few tales to spin by the firelight, there was a 
young woman who lived near the base of a mountain. Some say it was the tallest mountain to 
have ever existed, but who can say for sure now? 
What matters is that one day, she heard the whispers of the rains and the caress of the winds 
and followed them up the mountain. She stayed there for a day and a night and returned as 
the next dawn broke. “Where did you go?” her family asked her. She replied, “I walked up the 
mountain and the rains told me secrets of how to move them.” And though no one understood, 
village life moved on.
As the weather turned crisp, a stray spark landed on the drying grasses and the fire that 
followed would have immolated the village. While the people scrambled to get their buckets and 
bowls and blankets to quench the blaze, the woman who had walked up the mountain stepped 
forth. Her words and hands swept the river over the fire and put it out in an instant. The people 
stared, unable to understand what they had seen, before all crying out at once.
“You can command the river!” someone exclaimed. “You must be a god!”
“No,” she insisted softly as she backed away. “I simply listened to the winds and rains, and 
they showed me ways I can help.”
“The rains, of course!” cried a farmer. “Then you will bless us with healthy crops!”
“And you can bring us river fish,” cried a fisherman, “and ease our weary backs!”
More demands rang out from the people: heal the sick, raise a house, bless a child, find a 
truth, grace a marriage, bring justice, bring peace, give love, give joy, give and give and give. 
The woman backed further and further from the demands until she felt the cool stone of the 
mountain behind her. The mountain had never asked her for anything despite all that it had 
given. She retreated further still and became one with the mountain, escaping the incessant 
demands of her village forever.
Magic can do much, but those who wield it 
deserve respect and peace, lest they vanish like 
the woman into the mountain.

The heroes can recuperate from the events at the Introduction Ceremony, 
but they have only a brief moment of respite before the daily flow of life 
and learning at the Magaambya sweeps them up. The whole experience 
of the academy is now open to them: to attend classes, make friends with 
their fellow students, and grow in power and skill. Their Perquisite period 
of service continues, but rather than a series of specific daily tasks, they 
have flexibility to work their Perquisite obligations around their classes. 
The events of this chapter should be framed around, and woven with, 
the academic advancement rules beginning on page 62. You can gloss over 
the first few months of classes by having your players attempt their first 
check to Study as a downtime activity (as the heroes likely prefer different 
branches, they can attend different classes). Experiences in Chapter 1 
might prompt some heroes to change their primary or secondary branches, 
which they can do freely before this first Study check. Part of the reason 
new initiates receive tasks from each branch is to ensure they make a more 
informed choice. 
The heroes should have a second opportunity for academic downtime 
during this chapter, and perhaps even a third or fourth, at your discretion. 
There’s no hurry in the events here, as Stone Ghost and the gremlins are 
slow in their work and careful to not expose their plans just yet. Run the 
events in this chapter at a pace that works for your group.
This chapter is divided into three sections. The first presents services for 
some of the Magaambya’s teachers. The second contains vignettes with 
the heroes’ fellow students. The third is this chapter’s conclusion, when 
the heroes advance from initiates to attendants. This event is the students’ 
First Masking, and it doesn’t go as planned. 
Meet the Teachers
The following four encounters don’t need to be run in order and can be 
interspersed as you see fit throughout the heroes’ class attendance. They 
give opportunities to get to know some teachers at the Magaambya. 
BUG PROBLEMS
Koride Ulawa  (CN female human naturalist) is popular among many 
students for her laid‑back style and love of the macabre. She’s a Rain‑Scribe 
with a primary focus on magical ecology. Her favorite research areas are 
the parts of nature that many people find repulsive: fungus, decay, and 
insects. Her open and honest fascination with repellent subjects is oddly 
charming and often contagious. She’s the Magaambya’s most skilled 
entomologist in generations.
CHAPTER 2 SYNOPSIS
In this chapter, the heroes embark 
upon their first of many semesters 
of academic work. Their lessons 
are broken up with directives to 
help several teachers as well as 
opportunities to get to know their 
fellow initiates. During these tasks, 
the heroes discover that several 
infestations of insects have afflicted 
the Magaambya. This infestation 
reaches its height at the heroes’ 
First Masking ceremony, when they 
formally advance from initiates to 
attendants. Several enormous insects 
attack the ceremony to disrupt it, 
and the heroes have the opportunity 
to demonstrate their valor in front of 
their teachers and peers.
CHAPTER 2 TREASURE
The permanent and consumable 
items available as treasure in 
Chapter 2 are as follows.
• animal staff
• bracelet of dashing
• bracers of missile deflection
• cat’s eye elixir
• chest feather token
• hat of the magi
• moderate antidote (centipede venom 
only)
• onyx dog wondrous figurine
• potion of leaping
• potion of water breathing
• scroll of augury
• scroll of faerie fire
• scroll of fleet step
• scroll of negate aroma

Koride’s many flaws also endear her to students. She 
frequently neglects her commitments, failing 
to show up for classes or forgetting 
to follow up on homework she 
assigned. She has a reckless 
disregard for rules, especially 
rules that promote safety, and 
she casually dismisses them as 
impediments to education. She’s 
shameless about giving the best 
opportunities and materials to 
her favorite students, overlooking 
their mistakes with obvious 
indulgence. In short, she’s an 
irresponsible teacher, but with her 
popularity and the fact that she has yet 
to cause any real harm, her position at 
the Magaambya remains secure.
The NPC initiates have varied 
opinions about Teacher Ulawa. 
Anchor Root, Chizire, and Haibram 
all like her teaching style; Anchor Root is 
one of Koride’s favorites, despite being exceedingly 
uncomfortable with that “honor.” Esi can’t stand 
Koride and wonders aloud why everyone doesn’t 
agree that she’s an awful teacher and a terrible person. 
Ignaci and Mariama do their best to avoid her, keeping 
their heads down in her classes. The other initiates in 
the Spire Dormitory don’t really have an opinion.
For her part, Koride views new initiates as useful 
tools for her own ends, but she doesn’t see any reason 
to expend much energy being friendly with them. 
When Koride first received reports of insects around 
the Magaambya acting strangely, she ignored them, 
but when her own specimens started acting odd, she 
had to admit something was amiss. Further research 
was required, preferably on a cross‑section of insect 
specimens. Since there’s far too much ground for 
Koride to cover alone while still attending to her 
teaching duties (and, more to the point, because she 
would prefer not to), she delegates specimen gathering 
to the school’s newest students.
This task begins when Koride calls the heroes to her 
office. Her office is in the Heron Archives, one of first 
ten buildings constructed for the Magaambya in the 
days of Old‑Mage Jatembe. Each of these venerable 
buildings is named for one of the Ten Magic Warriors 
(in this case, Black Heron). When the heroes arrive at 
Koride’s office, read or paraphrase the following.
Heavy curtains cover the windows in Teacher Ulawa’s 
large office, with several oil lamps emitting a low light. A 
dizzying variety of glass encasements feature insects and 
reptiles, and a large cage hanging in a corner holds a small 
and surly vulture. Bookshelves are stuffed with papers, 
scrolls, and tomes in orderly piles. Shadow boxes on the 
walls hold dead insects pinned open 
to display their inner anatomy.
“You might have heard I’m 
the insect expert here,” says 
Teacher Ulawa, looking up from a scroll 
and tucking an errant piece of her 
headscarf back into place. “That 
means when the school has bug 
problems, they like to make it my  
problem. And since the group of you 
are still in your Perquisite period, I’m 
making it your problem.
“Something—or, more likely, several 
unrelated and coincident things—have 
been disturbing insects around the 
Magaambya, enough to threaten 
the ecological balance if left 
unchecked. Anchor Root and a 
few others have told me that something seems 
to be agitating them.” For a moment, genuine concern 
crosses Teacher Ulawa’s face, proof that she’s perhaps not 
as dismissive or disaffected as she seems. The look quickly 
fades. “Go to the places on this list, take note of any strange 
activity, and collect insect samples for me. Take immense 
care in collecting samples—further disruptions could cause 
the very problems I prefer to avoid.” She flaps a dismissive 
hand and returns to her work. “Oh, and do remember to 
wash thoroughly before returning with my samples.”
The heroes might volunteer gremlins as the cause, 
particularly if they know that some gremlins can 
speak with insects. Koride dismisses these suggestions 
with another rude wave of her hand, as “premature 
conclusions are the bane of logical evaluation.”
Koride provides a list of three locations on campus: 
the Leshy Gardens, the canal near the Speaker’s Stage, 
and the dining hall’s kitchen. After she gives the list to 
the heroes, she has another thought before taking back 
the list and scribbling “talk to Anchor Root about 
centipedes” on it. Koride is impatient for the heroes to 
get started, though she answers reasonable questions 
they have (such as where to find the locations).
The heroes can approach these locations in whatever 
order they desire.
Spire Dormitory
The heroes can find Anchor Root back at their 
dormitory. Anchor Root has noticed an uptick in 
the pests, particularly centipedes, burrowing into

appreciate a specimen. Anchor Root’s chicken familiar 
has eaten a lot of centipedes recently, and she worries 
that centipede venom might make her familiar sick. 
With Chizire’s help, she brewed a pot of centipede 
antivenom. This concoction spoils after a day, so 
Anchor Root encourages the heroes to drink up if 
they’ll be poking around for centipedes. She already 
fed it to her chicken and mumbles that there’s not 
likely to be too many side effects. The pot contains one 
dose of moderate antidote per hero, but the antidote’s 
bonus to Fortitude saving throws only applies to saves 
against centipede venom.
Ultimately, the dormitory doesn’t have many 
centipedes, and they’ve stayed well‑hidden to avoid 
being eaten by Anchor Root’s chicken. A hero must 
poke around the dorm for an hour and succeed at a 
DC 14 Nature or Survival check to capture a specimen.
Leshy Gardens
This overgrown section of campus is the domain of 
several leshys, who are uncommon elsewhere on 
campus (and in Nantambu for that matter). The chief 
groundskeeper, Thema (CG female elf gardener 6), 
discourages the leshys from ranging far from their 
patch of overgrown land because they have a tendency 
to cause mischief. The riotous Leshy Gardens is 
therefore a tangle of trees, shrubs, and vines amid 
carefully cultivated green space, such as sparring fields 
and picnic spots. Students sometimes come to ask the 
leshys for aid, particularly when stuck on a difficult 
assignment requiring a uniquely plant‑based outlook. 
Small, twisting paths lead into the Leshy Gardens, 
and the leshys are normally happy to have visitors. 
Most of the leshys are leaf leshys ( Pathfinder Bestiary 
218), but gourd leshys ( Bestiary 218) and flytrap 
leshys (Pathfinder Bestiary 2 161) live here as well.
If you haven’t yet run the Starday Tournament  
encounter, the leshys are busily carving large wooden 
plates to act as the armor for their constructs (though 
they haven’t yet completed any constructs and they’re 
secretive about what they’re making). If you’ve already 
run the Starday Tournament  encounter, the heroes 
find the leshys repairing their constructs and sharing 
observations about the deepest splits and scratches. 
If the heroes ask the leshys about troublesome 
insects, a friendly gourd leshy named Shade‑in‑Autumn 
explains their problem. An infestation of bark beetles 
has been gnawing on the bark plates they’ve been 
working, slowing their efforts. The leshys want the 
insects gone, so they asked Koride Ulawa for aid.
Finding and collecting a few beetles for Koride is 
also easy. Heroes who look for anything unusual can 
attempt a DC 16 Perception check to realize that the 
lines in the bark made by the beetles’ chewing form 
strange shapes. A hero looking over the patterns who 
succeeds at a DC 16 Arcana or Nature check realizes 
they resemble runes of summoning or conjuration. The 
beetles aren’t forming these patterns consciously—
they’re subject to the lure of the Vesicant Egg.
XP Award: If the heroes identify the odd runes in the 
bark, award them 30 XP.
The Speaker’s Stage
The west end of the island upon which the 
Magaambya was built extends into the canal on 
an artificial island. Several large stone basins form 
a ring around a grand stage on top of this artificial 
island, magically illuminating it. The Speaker’s Stage 
was designed as a place where representatives of the 
school could make pronouncements to Nantambu, but 
just as often, Magaambya students use it to put on 
concerts, plays, or other performances. By tradition, 
these performances must always be free of charge, and 
they’re quite popular in Nantambu, even the more 
amateurish ones. 
Delicate water striders crowd around the island, 
skating back and forth on the water. The insects are 
plainly agitated but difficult to catch because they dart 
about so quickly. Fetching a specimen requires a quick 
hand or a good sense of the creatures’ movements. A 
hero who succeeds at a DC 16 Nature, Survival, or 
Thievery check can catch one.
The activity at the Speaker’s Stage draws attention 
from townspeople across the canal who think there 
might be an impromptu performance at hand. They 
good‑naturedly shout at the heroes, asking what 
kind of show they’re putting on. The heroes don’t 
have to give any performance, of course, but a hero 
who succeeds at a DC 16 Performance check gives 
a spectacle that the crowd appreciates. The crowd 
mocks failed checks but with affable humor rather 
than meanness. 
Treasure: If the heroes give a successful performance, 
a finely dressed member of the crowd steps to the edge 
of the canal and introduces himself in a clear voice as 
Asanda. A hero who succeeds at a DC 10 Society check 
realizes that he’s one of the 11 magistrate‑mayors who 
govern Nantambu. Whether or not the heroes realize 
his identity, Asanda praises the performance and 
insists on giving a token of his gratitude. He deftly 
folds a blank ledger page into a paper boat, places a 
chest feather token  into it, and pushes it across the 
canal toward the heroes. 
Keep note of whether the heroes meet Asanda here, 
since they encounter him—or, rather, an impostor 
masquerading as Asanda—in the next adventure.

Kitchen Low 2
The dining hall is closed when the heroes arrive, even 
if they come during normal hours. Lumusi Yao is, 
uncharacteristically, in the dining hall keeping anyone 
from entering. She has a basket of mangoes and insists 
that everyone she turns away take one since she can’t 
feed them properly. If the heroes ask about insects in 
the area, Lumusi sighs with relief.
“I can tell you, then, even though I don’t want this to get 
out among the other students. We’ve been seeing a lot of 
mites recently. Many more than usual, and usual is none at 
all. Just a short time ago, I received a large basket of fresh 
cassava. When I opened it, there were so many mites on 
it that I dropped the basket, spilling the cassava and the 
mites across the floor. I asked my assistant Abena to sweep 
up the mess while I shooed everyone away.”
Lumusi asks the heroes to help Abena and take as 
many mites as they’d like. She appears visibly flustered 
throughout the conversation, insisting that she has 
never had a pest problem due to a combination 
of minor enchantments and folk knowledge, like 
placing copper coins in jars of water by the window 
or cleaning the floors in a secret solution of lemons, 
marigolds, and vinegar. When she found mites despite 
these precautions, she asked Koride what to do.
Things are worse than Lumusi fears. A swarm of 
centipedes, lured to the area by the Vesicant Egg and 
drawn to the kitchen because the centipedes find mites 
very tasty, have done the job of removing all the mites. 
However, the centipede swarm is both hungry and 
territorial. Abena barely avoided the swarm by leaping 
into a large cauldron and pulling the lid closed. When 
the heroes enter, they see the lid rattling and hear her 
cries for help from inside.
Creature: Before the heroes can reach Abena’s 
hiding place, the swarm of centipedes surges out from 
beneath the counters and tables. The swarm fights 
until reduced to 0 Hit Points and then disperses, but 
once the heroes defeat the swarm, they can collect 
individual specimens for Koride.

Treasure: Lumusi is grateful for the heroes’ help. She

and two cat’s eye elixirs that taste like cinnamon.
Returning to Koride
When the heroes return to Koride’s office with all the 
insect samples they’ve collected, Koride is impatient for 
a report. When the heroes recount the insects’ strange 
behavior, Koride’s face pulls into an increasingly 
serious frown. She notes that their findings might 
indicate a larger problem—one she will look into. 
Koride genuinely thanks the heroes for their help, and 
she asks the heroes to put the insects into a terrarium 
(perhaps with a snide comment like “not the centipedes 
with the other insects, you fools, they’re carnivorous” 
to show a bit of her characteristically sharp demeanor). 
She then waves the heroes away. 
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each type 
of specimen they bring from a different location, to a 
maximum of 120 XP.
TAKULU’S READING LIST
Takulu Ot has run into some trouble while doing 
research for a personal project: the source materials he 
needs should be within the Magaambya, but he can’t 
find them in any archives. Old transfer records indicate 
that they might be in temporary storage—specifically, 
in an old dormitory that was partially converted into 
a library but subsequently abandoned. He’d like the 
heroes to fetch his books but realizes this task isn’t 
so straightforward. The dormitory‑turned‑library was 
built into the stump of an enormous tree and might 
be infested with insects (as much of the Magaambya 
seems to be these days). No one has gone into the 
library in many years, and he doesn’t know the state 
of the stacks therein.
This task begins when Takulu asks the heroes to 
come to his office at a convenient time for them. The 
heroes can find his office, like Koride’s, in the Heron 
Archives. Read or paraphrase the following. 
“I have a favor to ask of you.” Teacher Ot looks up from 
the many books arranged around him with a furrow in 
his brow. “Some research materials I need are missing 
from the usual reference libraries. I’ve had initiates look 
for them with no success, and I’ve spoken with the other 
professors to see if perhaps what I need has landed in their 
more private collections. Again, no success. I now know 
where they aren’t, which tells me where they must be.” He 
pulls out a detailed map of the Magaambya’s grounds. “This 
building here—” he places a lens from his desk over what 
appears to be a round dormitory, magnifying it, “—hasn’t 
seen use in…” He trails off and shrugs before continuing.
“It was carved from an enormous stump as a dormitory 
but was being converted into a library before the project 
was abandoned. Please see if these five books are there.” 
Teacher Ot provides a short list. “Return them to me 
regardless of their condition. I would appreciate anything 
else you feel would be relevant or worth salvaging.”
Takulu doesn’t know why the library conversion 
was abandoned; in fact, no one still on campus does. 
Takulu seeks the following five works.
• Studies on the Habits and Migration Patterns of 
Birds and Drakes of the Continent of Garund , 
recorded in a leather‑bound book.
• An Expanded History of the Lesser-Known 
Peoples of the Mwangi Expanse , recorded on 
vellum and bound by leather cords.
• The Worlds Between Worlds: Exploring the 
Planes and Demi-Planes, Volume 4 , recorded in 
an extraordinarily large leather‑bound book.
• Treatise on the Various Communicative Methods 
of Non-Vocally-Projecting Entities, recorded on a 
scroll that whispers eerily when unrolled.
TAKE A BREAK
Every school year needs a few breaks in the 
monotony of constant classes, and the Magaambya 
is no exception. The regional and religious differences 
of those who attend, teach, and reside at the school 
mean that almost any day could be a holiday for 
someone. Emphasizing these holidays helps remind 
your players that time is passing.
The teachers make sure to observe holidays 
that are important to the students and staff. Also, 
as in any other school, some days simply become 
impromptu holidays to celebrate the small victories 
and accomplishments of friends. For instance, Chizire 
makes note of any birthdays he learns, as it’s a good 
time to sell—and imbibe—the output from his still. 
Esi hosts small and quiet “parties” that are more like 
laid-back afternoons of mutual decompression after 
particularly difficult exams. 
For a festival like Longnight, which occurs on a full 
moon in the winter, classes end earlier than normal 
and start late the next day to allow revelers time 
to recover. For longer festivals, like the weeks-long 
Burning Blades festival in the summer, classes are 
only canceled for the final day of the celebration. 
Days celebrating independence or harvest festivals 
might involve sharing culturally significant foods, 
and it isn’t uncommon for students to work together 
to bring small feasts to share with a class.

• Collected Field Notes of the Druid Mata 
Digemari, a small chest with cramped writing 
covering its wooden surfaces.
Takulu also seeks any other texts that seem 
interesting, regardless of their condition; he’s no 
stranger to both magical and mundane restoration 
efforts, so he doesn’t mind if the texts are damaged. 
The abandoned dormitory‑turned‑library is in an 
overgrown section of the campus grounds. When the 
heroes arrive, read or paraphrase the following.
Wrapped in overgrowth, the stump of an enormous tree 
squats on the Magaambya grounds. Its upper surface 
features several lightning scars, though it’s unclear whether 
these strikes killed the tree or occurred later. Windows, 
just visible beneath the concealing vines, are covered with 
thick films of dust on the inside. The vegetation around the 
door has recently been hacked away, providing an easy 
entry. A chain of silver bells lies discarded on the front step.
Takulu didn’t mention the open door, so the heroes 
might be suspicious. A close look reveals that the vines 
were all pulled apart, not cut, and some bear strange 
ink stains. A garland of tiny silver bells lies near the 
front step, as though torn away from the entrance. 
This chain of bells once hung by the door, but the 
gremlins that now infest the library quickly tossed it 
aside out of superstitious fear.
Treasure: The garland of silver bells is worth 10 gp.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each book 
they return to Takulu, to a maximum of 120 XP 
(because one book he wants is completely destroyed). 
Features of the Tree-Stump Library
Most of the library is a mess of sagging shelves, old 
beds, and torn books. The library interior is unlit, 
though just enough light comes in through the 
dusty, vine‑shrouded windows to provide dim light 
throughout. The doors are all lightweight wood and 
open easily with a push; the latches they once held 
have all been removed as part of the renovation.

viably fit one, and a few where it can’t. Books are wedged 
in sideways or simply thrown on the floor, their pages 
smeared into illegibility. Seven closed doors lead to other 
rooms. Surprisingly, little dust sits on the floor or shelves.
The shelves are 8 feet tall, and the ceiling is 10 feet 
high, leaving just enough space for the creatures in 
this room to move around on the shelves. A hero can 
topple these badly balanced shelves with a successful 
DC 13 Athletics check. 
None of Takulu’s books are here, but confirming 
their absence takes a few hours of searching.
Creatures: Four ink‑stained gremlins called scrits 
doze atop the shelves, lazy after smearing and then 
eating so many books. They’re hard to spot up there, 
particularly as they hide if they hear any evidence of 
intruders. They try to remain atop the shelves and out 
of reach while they cast grease to trip up the heroes, 
then jump down to jab with their inky fingers. They 
prefer to gang up on the least‑armored intruders. Most 
bells don’t bother them, but they’ve somehow come to 
believe that only silver bells are truly dangerous; the 
scrits take a –2 circumstance penalty to attack anyone 
openly carrying silver bells, as their caution impedes 
their aggression.
If two scrits are defeated, the others flee to area B7, 
hoping that the wasps there will aid them (but the 
insects don’t).

Items two scrits each wear a matching bracer of missile

Inquisitive Insects: If the heroes spend more than 10 
minutes poking through the books here, the silverfish 
in areas B3 and B5 hear them and come rushing out.
Treasure: Anyone searching the books finds a scroll 
of negate aroma and a scroll of faerie fire.
B2. Organization Station
This room seems to have served as a staging area for 
someone’s attempts to organize the collection. Several 
books sit open on one desk with notes next to them, atop 
scrolls with long lists. The other two desks precariously 
hold up several stacks of books and closed boxes. More 
boxes overflowing with books sit on the floor nearby, as if 
still waiting to be sorted.
When the makeshift library was being transported 
to this location, someone attempted the immeasurable 
task of chronicling, filing, and organizing each and 
every item into an inventory. Unfortunately, they only 
seemed to make it about a quarter of the way through. 
Of Takulu’s books, the only one listed on the inventory 
is The Worlds Between Worlds . A hero reading the 
inventory notes that five of its six volumes have been 
relocated to a southeast room (area B4).
Takulu’s Book: A hero who succeeds at a DC 12 
Perception check notices that one of the boxes stuffed 
with books is a chest with carved writings all over it, 
which is the Collected Field Notes of the Druid Mata 
Digemari. Ironically, the only one of Takulu’s books 
here isn’t on the inventory list.
Treasure: A gold key resting on the scrolls is worth 
35 gp—it doesn’t unlock anything here. 
B3. Dubious Research Trivial 2
This moist room has heaps of partially-chewed books 
and scattered papers, many of which have been pulped 
and mashed into strange, nest-like shapes. A crack in the 
wooden wall drips with moisture and is covered with a 
profusion of mold.
The books here are all compiled from the same 
research topic: potential positive uses for spells 
considered evil by the world at large. It seems someone 
was building to a thesis by studying these texts but left 
off the research a long time ago. As many of the books 
have gruesome subject matters (detailing evil spells 
and their effects in vivid detail), it’s perhaps best that 
the insects lairing here destroyed so many of them.
Creatures: The moisture and books have drawn 
a silverfish swarm and a giant silverfish. They 
aggressively attack anyone they detect in the library 
other than the scrits. Their clacking as they fight is 
loud enough to alert the silverfish in area B5. Those 
silverfish rush out to join the fight; together, all the 
silverfish make up a moderate encounter.

notes to Takulu, he pays them 50 gp and gives the 
slightest look of disgust upon reviewing its contents.

B4. Bed Storage
This room is jammed with simple beds and frames. They’re 
precariously stacked, as if arranged to simply keep them 
out of the way. Dusty boxes are shoved beneath them.
Handling the stacked beds is dangerous. Unless the 
hero moving them succeeds at a DC 16 Thievery check, 
the beds tumble and deal 2d6 bludgeoning damage to 
everyone in the room (DC 16 basic Reflex save). 
Takulu’s Book: The boxes are easy to reach and 
contain—among other various works—Volumes 1, 3, 
5, and 6 of Worlds Between Worlds. Volume 2 is long 
lost. Volume 4 is stashed beneath a blanket on one of 
the bottom beds. The heroes must unstack the beds 
then succeed at a DC 16 Perception check to find it.
Treasure: A bracelet of dashing is behind the boxes 
under the bed; anyone searching the boxes spots it.
B5. Miscellaneous Storage Trivial 2
Heaps of dormitory furniture have been pushed into this 
room, including several frayed wicker chairs, a jumble of 
coatracks, and two broken beds. The room is unpleasantly 
moist, and thin sheets of mold cover the chairs and bed.
This room’s contents seem to have been shoved 
around without much thought, the sure sign of a task 
completed rapidly, not properly. Ink‑stained blankets 
cover the moldy, broken beds the scrits sleep in.
Creatures: Two giant silverfish nest beneath the 
beds. They scuttle out if they detect intruders other 
than the scrits. If the heroes haven’t yet encountered 
the silverfish in area B3, those silverfish join the fight 
here, scuttling quickly across the main room. Together, 
the silverfish make up a moderate encounter.

B6. The Reading Nook Low 3 
While many broken stools and chairs lie scattered in the 
corner of this room, there’s also a comfortable armchair 
with piles of books arrayed around it. Someone might have 
used this armchair as a reading nook, though long enough 
ago that dust has accumulated over the books and chair. 
This room has been carefully arranged into a 
comfortable reading spot. Shortly after the library was 
abandoned, a student crept inside, found the collected 
lore too enticing to resist, and made this area her 
personal reading nook. She graduated many years ago, 
but the evidence of her special hideaway remains.
Creatures: Three spellskeins are trapped in this 
room. They know that the silverfish nearby love to eat 
scraps of cloth and paper like them, so they remain 
here out of fright. When the heroes first enter this 
room, the spellskeins hide and hope the heroes go 
away. If they start perusing the books, the spellskeins 
fold themselves into crane shapes and flutter around 
the room to get the heroes’ attention. They don’t 
intend to attack, although they defend themselves if 
the heroes initiate violence.
The spellskeins want a safe way out of the library. 
If they need to explain their agitation, one of the 
spellskeins folds itself into a reasonable approximation 
of a darting silverfish while the others mimic being 
afraid of it. If the heroes show these spellskeins a safe 
way out, they immediately take it. 
The heroes decide whether to let the 
spellskeins simply disperse into the campus 
or elsewhere in Nantambu; the heroes might 
even find a new home for them someplace else.

Takulu’s Books: The piles here contain several 
books relating to the ruined city of Bloodsalt, whose 
long‑vanished inhabitants supposedly sprouted wings 
and flew away. Also among the scattered stacks are 
ancillary works on Mwangi residents and dragons, 
bookmarked for useful cross‑referencing. Both Studies on 
the Habits and Migration Patterns of Birds and Drakes 
of the Continent of Garund and An Expanded History 
of the Lesser-Known Peoples of the Mwangi Expanse are 
here. A slim folio contains a partial map of the ruined 
city; though this cartography might not seem of much 
interest now, note whether the heroes take it (whether 
to keep or to give to Takulu), as it proves helpful in 
Pathfinder Adventure Path #171: Hurricane’s Howl.
Treasure: The long‑gone student left her animal 
staff behind the overstuffed chair. The folio containing 
the map also has a narrow scroll of fleet step  used as 
a bookmark.
XP Award: If the heroes help the spellskeins out of 
the library, award them 80 XP. 
B7 . Ceaseless Buzzing
A faint buzzing echoes in this mostly empty room. Two 
laden shelves are crammed into the entrance, and a mass 
of matted paper hangs from the ceiling against the wall 
opposite the door.
A swarm of wasps has been working on this nest for 
some time, which accounts for its size, but the swarm 
isn’t large or aggressive enough yet to pose a threat. The 
scrits don’t realize that the wasps won’t fight for them, 
however, so they retreat here in the misplaced hopes the 
wasps will protect them.
Takulu’s Ruined Book: Careful examination of the nest 
reveals that some of the paper used in its construction 
moans softly. These remnants once belonged to a scroll 
called A Treatise on the Various Communicative Methods 
of Non-Vocally-Projecting Entities. The scroll’s title is 
the only piece that’s still legible; the scrits have smeared 
the rest into illegibility and then tore it apart, providing 
material for the wasp nest. It can’t be recovered, even by 
Takulu’s skills at book restoration.
B8. Library Supplies
Aside from a handful of books and journals in boxes on the 
floor, this room is empty.
The boxes contains extra supplies, such as blank 
journals, quills, charcoal, and writing implements. 
Although the heroes can easily replenish their academic 
materials here, they aren’t of much value.
MONOCHROME MURMURS
There are those who might call Teacher Zuma (CN 
male half‑orc conspiracy theorist) eccentric. He 
would, most likely, correct them with a deeply—if 
questionably—referenced rant about the need for 
alternative methods of information gathering and 
dissemination within the current political and magical 
climate. The teacher’s intellect is sharp, and his 
mastery of defensive magic is superb. Zuma’s ability to 
distinguish strands of truth (though perhaps, at times, 
picking up “truths” where none exist) qualified him 
early on for the Emerald Boughs, and he’s now one of 
that branch’s most colorful members. Zuma’s classes 
range from details of eminently useful rituals to utterly 
nonsensical ramblings, often within the space of only 
a few minutes. He’s well liked, although few students 
(or teachers) have the mental fortitude to interact with 
him for long. Tzeniwe, normally gracious and caring 
with everyone, has little patience for Zuma because 
she sees “when a web of thoughts is poorly shaped 
from insufficient foundations.”
Zuma is currently testing a process to share magical 
abilities. He needs a group of willing volunteers who 
aren’t too far along in their magical studies to help 
him test a special tattoo ink, and the new initiates fit 
his requirements perfectly. Zuma asks any hero who’s 
a member of the Emerald Boughs to bring their friends 
by his office when convenient; if there are none, he gets 
the word to them through Ignaci.
Zuma has one of the few offices in the Elephant 
Museum. He insisted on an office here, among 
the Uzunjati teachers, because of powerful but 
undetectable defenses he believes Jatembe imbued into 
the building named after his greatest chronicler. When 
the heroes arrive, read or paraphrase the following. 
“Ah, are you the new volunteers being sent to me?” 
Teacher Zuma gives an eager grin and rubs his hands 
together. “Volunteerism is a sign of…” The half-orc seems 
poised to launch into a rambling rant, but he shakes his 
head and returns to the subject at hand. “No need for 
you to be nervous about this little process, this shouldn’t 
hurt anyone too much. At least not if I carried the five in 
the formula, ah?” He guffaws as he opens a door from 
the sprawling mess of his office to an even-more-chaotic 
laboratory behind it. A bright-green liquid burbles in a 
flask and travels through a dizzying network of spiraling 
tubes until it becomes something dark and swirling in a 
much smaller bottle. Pinned to the wall are several scraps 
of paper, each bearing a separate piece of an impossibly 
complex alchemical formula.
“Your role here is simple: just sit still and focus while I 
attempt to prove my theorem that it is possible to entangle

and connect the magically inclined essences of multiple 
persons in such a way that they may, in fact, 
be able to affect each other’s dependent 
natures and cause independent 
changes on those who are part of 
the created system of magically 
inclined individuals. Perfectly 
logical and natural, of course, 
when you think about it.”
Zuma has already completed 
most of his preparations; he has 
followed his formula and produced 
a bottle of special tattoo ink. When 
applied to skin, the ink is supposed 
to permit the heroes’ inherent 
magic to “talk between them,” 
amplifying individual effects. 
However, the ink doesn’t quite 
work as intended. Although his ritual 
indeed magically connects the heroes, it 
only allows them to share words, not magic. 
Zuma performs the following ritual as the primary 
caster. The heroes are all secondary casters, and Zuma 
insists on their participation whether or not they’re 
trained in Arcana or Occultism. The heroes can pick 
the tattoo’s shape, but it must be the same on all of 
them and must include a mouth, if only a small one.
Tattoo Ritual: Zuma’s ritual, in its current form, is 
as follows.
TATTOO WHISPERS RITUAL 3
RARE AUDITORY DIVINATION LINGUISTIC MENTAL
Cast 1 hour; Cost tattoo inks and silver tattooing needles 
worth 20 gp for each secondary caster; Secondary 
Casters 2, up to a maximum of 6
Primary Check Crafting (expert); Secondary Checks  
Arcana, Occultism
Range touch; Targets the secondary casters
You carefully tattoo the same design upon each secondary 
caster. The tattoo can be of any shape or symbol, but it 
must include a mouth. The tattoo fades naturally over the 
course of 1 month.
Critical Success  The tattoos on the secondary casters 
are all magically linked for 1 week, providing a 
semi-telepathic bond. Each secondary caster can 
communicate secretly with any other secondary casters 
at any time by mouthing words but making no sound. 
The person receiving a message must be within 120 feet 
of the sender, must be within the sender’s line of sight, 
and must have their tattoo uncovered. The mouth of 
the tattoo moves to match the words, which the tattoo 
whispers, but only the tattoo’s bearer can hear it.
Success As critical success, but the effect lasts for 1 day.
Failure The ritual has no effect.
Critical Failure  The ritual has no effect and creates a 
backlash of persistent mental static. All casters 
are stupefied 1 for 1 day.
To enact the ritual, the heroes must first 
attempt their DC 22 checks as secondary 
casters, which affects Zuma’s primary 
check as described on page 408 of the 
Core Rulebook. Zuma then attempts the 
primary check (DC 27 Crafting). You 
can roll his Crafting check with a +20 
modifier, or you can simply assume his 
total is 30.
Testing the Effects: Zuma asks 
the heroes to try to cast one of 
their spells at the highest level they 
can. When this casting proves to be no 
higher a level than they can normally cast, 
he scribbles several notes and asks the heroes to 
try casting a spell they’ve seen another hero cast but 
which they can’t cast themselves. When none of the 
heroes can cast in this way, he anxiously scribbles more 
notes. Finally, he asks the heroes to try to communicate 
with each other silently. If the ritual succeeded, they 
can do so, as described in the ritual. In any case, Zuma 
has some good notes about how he can improve his 
ink formula. He thanks the heroes for their time and 
dismisses them so he can get back to work.
Treasure: Zuma gives a cheap‑looking costume hat 
to the hero who seemed most interested in his ritual. 
He assures them that this hat of the magi will protect 
them from “unwanted mental influences.” While the 
hat might look ridiculous, it really is magic, but has no 
more power than an ordinary hat of the magi. 
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for participating 
in Zuma’s ritual. If the ritual succeeds, increase this 
amount to 80 XP.
THE STARDAY TOURNAMENT
One of the most famous teachers currently on campus 
is Mafika Ayuwari (NG male human martial artist), 
a young Tempest Sun‑Mage teacher who believes 
everyone must be prepared for a physical fight, no 
matter how great their magical prowess. He recently 
returned from Tian Xia, where his team fought in the 
fabled Ruby Phoenix Tournament. They didn’t win 
but did well enough to earn international acclaim and 
no small amount of celebrity on campus.
Mafika aims to build fighting skills with monthly 
tournaments on campus. For the first tournament since 
his return, he has obtained the aid of the campus’s leshys

to grow tough constructs of living wood to “ride” into 
fights. This tournament is intended for initiates and 
attendants; conversants and more senior members of 
the Magaambya aren’t permitted to participate this 
month. Notices like Handout: Fight Announcement  
(right) are posted in the heroes’ dormitory prior to the 
Starday tournament. 
Any hero asking about the tournament learns about 
Teacher Ayuwari’s reputation. Each tournament is 
slightly different, though this one is the first to be 
held at the Leshy Gardens in a long time. Haibram, in 
particular, can’t stop talking about it.
When the party arrives at the sparring arena, 
whether they plan to participate or not, a crowd has 
started building in anticipation.
A throng of students crowds around the edge of the cleared 
sparring space near the Leshy Gardens. Chizire waves from 
an open spot near the front. “You haven’t been to one of 
these yet, have you? Fft, you’re in for quite the treat.” 
He flashes a bright grin.
A tall young woman wearing the simple 
wooden mask of an attendant waits in the 
middle of the clearing, staff at the ready. A 
loud rustle blows through the surrounding 
trees. Stepping out from behind the hedge 
is a 10-foot-tall construct made of branches 
woven into a humanoid frame. It holds a 
wooden sparring sword in one hand and a large 
wooden shield in the other. Within the construct, 
plainly in control, a smiling leaf leshy gives a brief 
wave. The construct bows to the attendant and 
adopts a defensive stance. 
“Signing up is easy,” Chizire purrs 
helpfully. “It can be quite fun, really. 
You just need to step forward.” Within 
the sparring ground, the attendant has 
already been knocked flat on her back, looking 
up in surprise and fear at the wooden blade aimed down at 
her throat. The construct sheathes the sword with a flourish 
and offers a hand up. From the hedge erupts a chorus of 
cheers from several leshys relaxing amid the leaves. Teacher 
Ayuwari chuckles and calls the name of the next combatant.
The tournament consists of three bouts against 
leshy‑piloted constructs, each bout more difficult than 
the last. A group of up to 6 participants can enter as a 
team, but only a maximum of 2 people can participate 
in each bout (thus, a team of 6 need not have anyone 
fight more than once and can still have 2 people in 
each bout). There’s no prohibition against fighting 
multiple times, so a team of one can enter but would 
have to individually handle all three bouts in a row. 
A team who wins all three bouts is that month’s 
victor; the team that does so with the least injuries 
wins if there is a tie. If no one wins the final bout, 
Mafika declares that there’s no formal winner, but the 
leshys call themselves the victors and become 
insufferably boastful for months.
Haibram, Esi, and Mariama form a team 
together, but they don’t last past the second 
bout—due to a spot of poor luck, one of 
Mariama’s strikes causes the construct 
to implode in a burst of branches that 
knock her and Haibram unconscious 
(leaving the startled and exposed leshy 
to rush back into the bushes). You can 
decide whether other teams participate 
and how well they fare.
Gaining the Upper Hand
The heroes might seek ways 
to improve their chances in 
the tournament or just get more 
details about what they’ll face. The 
easiest place to accomplish either option 
is over by the leshy‑occupied bush at the edge 
of the Leshy Gardens. While the leshys can’t be 
bribed or coerced into doing any less than their best 
in a fight, they love to gossip about each other and 
their constructs. Keeping the flighty leshys on track, 
however, can sometimes prove difficult. For example, 
some might be more interested in explaining their deep 
understanding of weather patterns or learning the 
latest updates in primal magic theory. If a hero talking 
with the leshys succeeds at a DC 16 Diplomacy check, 
the leshys remain sufficiently on task to give specific 
details about the number and type of constructs used 
in each bout, along with their relative power levels. 
The leshys also identify the weaknesses to critical hits 
and fire that all their constructs have.

The heroes can watch other bouts to learn more. On 
a successful DC 16 Perception check, a hero identifies 
the constructs’ weaknesses to critical hits and fire.
While Mafika tolerates (and, in fact, encourages) 
team members to work together within the limits of 
the tournament rules, he has a well‑known distaste for 
poor sportsmanship. Nevertheless, if the heroes want 
to engage in any trickery or subterfuge, decide on an 
appropriate skill and use a DC of 16. For example, 
a successful DC 16 Deception check can cause a 
distraction between bouts to allow enough time for 
one team member to use Treat Wounds on another.
FIGHTING IN THE TOURNAMENT
If the heroes step forward to fight, either as one team or 
multiple teams, the foes they must face in each bout are 
listed below. Each bout continues until one side yields. 
The students are expected to attack the constructs, not 
the leshy pilots inside. Direct attacks against the leaf 
leshy pilots result in automatic disqualification, but 
sometimes, damage to a leshy might be unavoidable, 
as with an area spell or splash damage from a bomb (a 
leshy in a construct has greater cover).
Mafika allows a maximum of 5 minutes between 
each bout, which provides enough time for healing 
spells but not enough to Treat Wounds. Students 
joining the next fight might have to start with injuries 
from the prior bout. The leshys fully heal their 
constructs during this time, except for the effects of 
the constructs’ Critical Vulnerability. Teammates who 
aren’t fighting in a bout can’t enter the sparring area 
or affect the constructs, but any spells they can cast to 
affect their participating teammates from 30 feet away 
are acceptable. If a student is unconscious with no 
one to help, Mafika stabilizes them.
BOUT 1  TRIVIAL 2
In the first bout of the tournament, the 
participating heroes face a single shieldbearer 
construct. This is a Trivial encounter for a 
party at full strength, but since at most two 
heroes fight at once, the combat presents a 
greater challenge. 
Creatures: The leshy piloting the 
construct is a show‑off. They intentionally 
miss with Attacks of Opportunity, instead 
swinging the sword in a showy display that 
draws cheers from the spectators. The leshy 
yields when they, or their construct, are 
reduced to 6 Hit Points or fewer.

Ridden Construct  The construct is piloted by a leaf 
leshy (Pathfinder Bestiary  218) , who can be targeted 
separately but has greater cover. The leshy can’t take 
actions of their own while inside the construct, other 
than to leave it, which takes 1 minute.

The second bout is against a shieldbearer construct 
and a smaller sicklehand construct that has a leaner 
build and curved wooden blades for hands.
Creatures: Unlike the shieldbearer in the first bout, 
this construct makes Attacks of Opportunity when 
it can. The sicklehand stays mobile and attempts to 
trip its foes. If the sicklehand successfully trips a hero, 
the leshy inside recommends that the hero yield; if 
the hero doesn’t comply, it presses its attack. A leshy 
yields when they, or their construct, are reduced to 6 
Hit Points or fewer.

In the final bout, the participating heroes must fight 
the most powerful of the leshy constructs: a towering 
bramble champion. Three sicklehand constructs fight 
alongside the bramble champion.
Creatures: The bramble champion carries a large 
wooden maul made of soft wood, so the bludgeoning 
damage it deals is nonlethal. The sicklehand constructs 
work together to flank foes whenever possible to 
increase their damage and generally harry anyone 
avoiding melee with the bramble champion. A leshy

Extracurricular Activities
The instructors aren’t the only ones in need of aid;  
fellow students also need an occasional helping hand. 
The following favors are entirely optional and can 
serve as ways for heroes to deepen their friendships 
with their peers. Most encounters listed below only 
require one or two skill checks, but feel free to expand 
these into longer roleplaying encounters or introduce 
greater challenges.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP for each favor 
they successfully provide.
CRICKET THEFT
Chizire has an idea for a new brew, but he needs a 
special ingredient: rare and magical crickets taken from 
Koride’s office insect collection. To get into the office 
unseen, a hero must succeed at a DC 15 Stealth 
check (or, alternatively, a DC 15 Deception 
check to Impersonate someone who comes and 
goes from the Heron Archives regularly). A hero 
can open the tricky latch on the crickets’ terrarium 
with a successful DC 15 Thievery check to Pick a 
Lock. On a failure at either of these checks, Koride 
catches the heroes in the act. She has little punishment 
beyond stern words, as she’s busy and doesn’t want 
the distraction of submitting a formal disciplinary 
complaint, but she magically protects her office so the 
heroes can’t try again.

drinks the potion is sickened 1 and can’t recover from 
the sickened condition while the potion is in effect. He 
gives it to the heroes with a wry thanks. 
LOFTY LEAP
Haibram has built a new, compact hang glider, and 
he needs to get as much height as he can to try it out. 
He knows the Soaring Spire permits impossible leaps 
from the ground, but he has a plan to go even higher. 
He asks one of the heroes to leap to the peak of the 
Soaring Spire and balance there with their fingers 
interlocked. Haibram will leap into the hero’s hands 
and then propel himself up another 60 feet, taking 
him more than 100 feet from the ground. The hero 
providing aid must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics 
check to Balance atop the spire followed by a DC 15 
Athletics check to hurl Haibram as high as possible. If 
the hero succeeds at both checks, he considers his hang 
glider a success, and he insists he owes it all to the hero 
who helped him.
LOST CHICKEN
Anchor Root’s chicken familiar has escaped from the 
dormitory and Anchor Root can’t find it. She’s too 
wracked with self‑recrimination to provide much help 
while searching, but the heroes aid her by looking 
around. A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception 
check finds the chicken—it wandered too close to the 
Soaring Spire just outside the dormitory and now 
frantically runs back and forth on the dormitory 
roof. With a successful DC 15 Athletics check, a 
hero catches the darting bird to safely bring it down. 
Anchor Root squeaks a quick and high‑pitched thanks 
before hastily returning to her room.
RULES MASTERY
Okoro has managed to get his hands on a new board 
game, one with incredibly dense and complex rules. 
He has excitedly requested a few people to play with 
him to test it ahead of the biweekly game night. To 
understand the rules, a hero must succeed at a DC 14 
Occultism or Society check to Decipher Writing. On a 
critical success, the hero realizes that the rules reference 
page is a cipher concealing a scroll of augury. 
Any player who succeeds at a DC 18 Occultism 
or Society check to Recall Knowledge wins the game 
(there can be multiple winners), but heroes who 
didn’t succeed at the check to understand the rules 
must decrease the degree of success of their Society or 
Occultism check to play the game by one step. 
Treasure: Okoro is impressed with any hero that 
finds the scroll hidden in the instructions. He lets them 
keep that page.
SURPRISE!
Zachva and Zanvi corner the heroes to ask for help in 
preparing a surprise birthday party for their mother, 
Tzeniwe. While they leave the particulars to the 
heroes, they hover incessantly during the planning and 
decorating process. Their constant bickering and their 
distracting “help” threaten to derail the party. The 
heroes can either ask Esi or Noxolo to keep the twins 
out of trouble (which requires a PC to succeed at a 
DC 13 Diplomacy check to convince either of them), 
or a hero who succeeds at a DC 17 Deception check 
can distract the twins and keep them out of the way.
So long as the heroes can plan, the birthday party is 
a success, much to Tzeniwe’s delight. She’s particularly 
grateful to the heroes for working so hard behind the 
scenes. A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Perception 
check to Sense Motive realizes she wasn’t actually 
surprised but pretends her best to please her children.
The First Masking 
To advance to the rank of attendants, initiates must 
craft a mask during their First Masking ceremony. 
This ceremony involves genuine and often lengthy 
work, as the students each craft a mask under 
the eye (and sometimes the aid) of their teachers. 
There’s one blank mask present for each initiate 
going through the ceremony. Although made of plain 
wood with simple eye slits, the masks have magical 
transformative potential. Containers of cloth, beads, 
feathers, and metals are all nearby, and incorporating 
these materials along with shaping the wood allows 
an initiate to focus their experiences and aspirations 
into the mask’s final form, magically shaping it beyond 
what mere craftsmanship can produce.
The heroes aren’t the only ones attending the First 
Masking. Every initiate from the Spire Dormitory is 
making their first mask, and several teachers will be 
present to guide their work. The upcoming ceremony 
is all the NPC initiates can talk about, so the heroes 
certainly know of the upcoming event. They should 
have plenty of time to consider what shape and type of 
mask they want to make. Animals are the most typical 
shapes for Magaambyan masks, but other shapes 
(particularly celestial objects or supernatural beasts) 
aren’t uncommon. 
You might set aside some time between play sessions 
or during a play session for the players to discuss what 
masks their characters want to create, as this decision is 
important for any initiate. They’ll be known according 
to the appearance of their mask for the rest of their 
career at the Magaambya.
The day of the First Masking is an exciting one for 
all the initiates in the Spire Dormitory. They prepare

their finest attire, aware that the ceremony starts off 
somber before turning joyous only once they’ve all 
completed their masks.
TIRELESS HALL
The ceremony takes place in Tireless Hall, the building 
named for Golden Snake, a serpent‑person also known 
as the Tireless Guide. Tireless Hall is often the site of 
lengthy rituals or ceremonies, as popular rumor holds 
that participants are less likely to become exhausted 
while within its walls. Teachers whose classes are 
reputed to be dull sometimes arrange to hold lectures 
in Tireless Hall, hoping to make their students less 
inclined to sleep through class.
Tireless Hall’s principal auditorium is the site of the 
First Masking ceremony. This large, wood‑paneled 
auditorium can seat more than a hundred people. 
It’s located on the building’s ground floor, with its 
southern end below ground to accommodate the 
ranks of benches that ascend to the north. To provide 
even more seating, a wide balcony overlooks the 
auditorium, above the lower rows of benches.
The map of the auditorium appears above. 
THE CEREMONY  SEVERE 2
In addition to teachers the heroes have met (Takulu, 
Koride, Zuma, and Mafika) and the Spire Dormitory 
initiates, the auditorium holds many friends, family 
members, and other well‑wishers. You might even 
ask the players who among their characters’ family 
and friends might attend this important occasion. 
Once everyone has assembled, Takulu Ot begins the 
ceremony with a short speech about what the students 
are there to do.
“Today you will make your first true mask. Each student’s 
mask is an embodiment of their learning and a reminder of 
the idea that, over time, people gain other names and faces. 
Although a mask is worn over the face, it is a reflection of 
who a person is underneath as well as a visualization of 
who the person hopes to become. The person beneath a 
mask has flaws, as all people do, but they also have hopes, 
dreams, and memories that define them. 
“We shall work together to make your first true mask, 
the expression of your spirit face within. What you do with 
this mask is up to you. Some wear it proudly and at every 
opportunity, a sign of who they have become, with their 
souls writ plain upon their faces. Others choose to keep 
their mask secret and safe, cherished and shown only to 
those they trust most in life. Many find somewhere to fall 
in between.
“The ceremony itself will be conducted in several parts. 
First, the initiates will come forward with their cohort 
and will begin, with the teachers, the rituals necessary to 
mold and create one of these plain masks. The task is an 
artistic one, of course, for painting a mask or adorning it 
with beads or feathers is an artistic task, but your hands 
will be guided by your spirit—its final shape is what you 
will it to be.
“You will then hold your mask, meditating upon its 
meaning, as the rest of your cohort completes their 
masks. Your mask may change shape in your hands as you 
meditate; this is not unexpected, and it means your mask 
is attuning itself to you.
“Then, at my signal, all in your cohort will don your 
masks as one. You see the urn there—it is a receptacle 
for your beads, if you wish. You need not wear them any 
longer, for when you don your mask you cease to be an 
initiate and become an attendant of the Magaambya.
“Esi Djana, come forward with your cohort.” 
The NPC initiates go first, by their cohort groups: 
Anchor Root, Chizire, and Esi are first; then Ignaci, 
Okoro, and Tzeniwe; then Haibram, Mariama, and 
Noxolo. Each group takes about half an hour to make 
their masks and don them before returning to their 
seats. All the teachers actively help the students shape

their masks, particularly Takulu. However, Koride 
reserves her aid for those students she likes, including 
Anchor Root, Chizire, and Haibram.
The heroes then take their turn, magically shaping 
their masks. No check is required, as the teachers guide 
the ritual with practiced ease. As the heroes meditate 
before putting their masks on, anyone who succeeds 
at a DC 20 Perception check hears a strange grinding 
coming from within the walls around the auditorium. 
Takulu doesn’t hear it, and he proceeds with the 
ceremony by directing the heroes to put on their masks. 
Just as the heroes don their masks, the insects 
burrowing through the walls attack.
The auditorium walls explode inwards with the weight of 
several giant beetles scrambling over one other. A flood of 
bugs follows them, a clicking, chittering, writhing mass that 
flows into the auditorium and throws the crowd into chaos.
There are more insectile attackers than the heroes 
could possibly hope to face on their own, but they 
aren’t alone; the other teachers and initiates fight back 
as well. You don’t need to track every participant in 
the fight. You should just concentrate on the insects 
that fight the heroes, as provided below.
You can narrate the fighting elsewhere in the 
auditorium by looking at how well the heroes fare. If 
the heroes are hard‑pressed, the giant insects are doing 
well. If the heroes start to get their fight under control, 
the other Magaambyans begin to overcome their foes. 
You might briefly narrate the action elsewhere, such as 
Teacher Ayuwari swinging a staff to crack an insect’s 
carapace, Teacher Ot distracting a giant centipede 
by casting glitterdust and ushering several spectators 
to safety, or Haibram leaping onto a giant bee in 
mid‑flight and grappling it to the ground. Once the 
heroes have finished their fight, the teachers and other 
students defeat or repel the last of insects as well.
Creatures: Five big bugs focus their attentions on 
the heroes, fighting them rather than anyone else 
in the auditorium. The giant goliath beetle simply 
lumbers to the closest hero. The giant centipedes 
scuttle around to fight heroes who hang back. 
The flash beetles fly over the goliath beetle to 
flank whomever the big beetle is facing. 
The aggressive and determined goliath 
beetle fights until killed. A giant centipede 
that takes any damage tries to bite 
the hero who attacked it, then it 
flees. A flash beetle that takes any 
damage uses its Light Flash and flees as well. Fleeing 
insects retreat into the tunnels or out of the auditorium 
entrances, whichever is closer.

After the Battle:  Koride examines any insects left 
behind, observing out loud that these insects don’t 
work together naturally and that they must have been 
compelled to attack. Mafika and Zuma dart into the 
tunnels to finish off any fleeing insects. 
Takulu insists that the initiates, or rather—he corrects 
himself with pride—the attendants, should ensure 
everyone made it to safety outside the auditorium 
before heading back to their dormitories to rest and 
recover from their injuries. Takulu assures everyone 
that the instructors and more experienced students of 
the Magaambya will conduct a full investigation into 
the cause and extent of this strange attack.

The Queen of Bees was stern and judicious, always striving to make the best decisions, yet her 
subjects were dour and sullen. The Young Trickster, a favorite of Grandmother Spider, went to 
the Queen of Bees with a smile and a plan. But two guards at the gates stopped him.
“What do you want, little troublemaker?” they buzzed, stingers at the ready. “Our Queen has 
no use for your antics on this or any other day. Begone.”
“I am here to give your Queen a great gift,” the Trickster insisted. “You would never want to 
deny your Queen a gift out-of-hand, would you? I could go to the Lord of the Hornets… Please, 
one of you should ask her first, at least.” One guard, head high, went to inform the Queen.
For a long time, the remaining guard and the Young Trickster stood in silence, so the Young 
Trickster hummed to himself, tapped his many feet, and started to dance. “Stop that,” the 
guard thrummed in annoyance and rushed forward. But the Young Trickster swept him into 
his dance, dancing and twirling. What fun it was! Soon, the other guard returned.
“What is happening here?” the returning guard demanded, but received no answer. The 
returning guard tried to intervene but was swept into the dance as well! The Queen’s steward, 
and architect, and handmaidens all came, each joining the dance in turn. Then the Queen 
herself came, for what had befallen her subjects? By now, the Young Trickster stood aside, 
watching the bees. The Queen saw their dancing and their delight.
“Young Trickster, you have given my people a new way 
to communicate. What is your price for this?”
“It is enough to see you join the dance,” 
the Trickster said. So she did.
And that is how bees learned to speak 
through dance. Then some people learned 
from watching them, and they made 
their own dances. And this is why so 
many dances tell stories.

As the dust settles and those injured during the First Masking ceremony 
recover, the Magaambya’s instructors begin the precarious balancing act 
of investigating the strange activities of the insects on the grounds, calming 
the students, and making sure the unusual attacks don’t extend into the 
city of Nantambu. The faculty’s first order of business is to explore and 
clear the meandering passages and recently carved tunnels beneath the 
campus. Relying upon trustworthy students is vital, since quickly exploring 
as much ground as possible may help prevent another attack. 
The greatest priority goes to those tunnels around and beneath Tireless 
Hall, but a quick investigation of other nearby buildings shows several 
tunnels in those areas, too. While the faculty focuses their attentions 
beneath Tireless Hall, assuming they can find the most clues there, they 
delegate the exploration of other tunnels to less‑experienced students, 
such as the heroes. Koride Ulawa is given the task of assigning duties to 
the cohorts and getting them into action.
Of course, Koride gives her favorite students what seems like the easiest 
task, the examination of the tunnels beneath Archhorn Library, far from 
Tireless Hall. However, those students were intimidated by evidence of 
giant insects in these tunnels, so Koride indulgently agreed to replace them 
with a different group: the heroes.
No one realizes the danger the heroes are about to be in. Far too canny 
to keep his base of operations near Tireless Hall, Stone Ghost guessed 
that the faculty would, indeed, focus their attentions there. He arranged 
several looping tunnels, partial collapses, and intriguing (but mundane) 
runes to hold their attention while he advanced his other plans. His base 
of operations and his most diligent gremlin minions lie far from Tireless 
Hall, beneath Archhorn Library—an area the heroes will soon explore.
To give the heroes their task, Takulu and Koride summon the students 
to the steps ascending to the imposing entrance of Archhorn Library.
Teacher Ot and Teacher Ulawa stand on the wide stone steps. While Teacher Ot 
carefully reviews a sheaf of papers, Teacher Ulawa looks annoyed, the corner of 
her mouth in a sneer. “How good of you to finally arrive,” she says. “Your little 
cohort is far from my first choice for something so critical to—”
“Koride, please,” Teacher Ot says softly, but firmly, then turns to you. “After 
your services to the Magaambya during your First Masking, we feel you are 
ready for an important task. Something is going on underneath Tireless Hall, and 
indeed beneath more of the Magaambya than we first realized. We are sending 
groups of students into the tunnels we have discovered in an effort to map them 
as thoroughly as possible. You will be one of these groups.” 
CHAPTER 3 SYNOPSIS
After the insect attack at the end of 
the previous chapter, the teachers 
and students must all pitch in 
to explore the maze of passages 
beneath the school. The heroes are 
assigned a distant, and presumably 
safe, set of caverns beneath 
Archhorn Library, but within these 
passages, the vengeful oread Stone 
Ghost and his gremlin minions work 
to expand the tunnels and prepare 
more attacks. The heroes can defeat 
Stone Ghost and learn that he was, 
in an earlier life, a cruel student 
expelled from the university. The 
aftermath of the insect attack and 
the discoveries beneath Archhorn 
Library hint at greater dangers. The 
sudden arrival of new anadi students 
promises some answers, but the 
heroes must first defend them 
against hungry griffons.

The permanent and consumable 
items available as treasure in

Teacher Ot points across to Tireless Hall. “There is where 
the attack occurred. But in the lowest levels of all these 
buildings,” he waves to the buildings around it, including 
Archhorn Library behind him, “we’ve found more tunnels. 
Many lead to old cave networks, now connected together 
by recent digging. Intentional, directed digging.”
Teacher Ulawa picks up the explanation. “I sent some 
students into the basement here in Archhorn Library, to 
explore and map the caves. It rapidly became obvious that 
this would be a more involved task than we originally 
anticipated. I withdrew that group, and you will be going 
in; you may even manage to make it back out in one piece.” 
She chuckles grimly. “We’ll at least wait and see how you 
manage before sending in the inevitable help.”
Teacher Ot steps aside and gestures to the library 
building. “The first group’s notes should still be in the 
basement. We can hope that Koride’s handpicked students 
were… comprehensive before learning that their feet might 
get muddy and then pleading for a different assignment.”
Teacher Ulawa shrugs. “Their skills were needed 
elsewhere, Takulu. It’s up to your motley band of novices to 
pick up where they left off.”
Takulu adds, “We’ll be making our own explorations 
beneath Tireless Hall, where we believe the danger is 
greater, should you need to draw us away for anything. 
But your task is before you, as ours is before us.”
The party’s instructions are simple: explore the 
caves beneath Archhorn Library, map it to the best of 
their abilities, and handle any threats they can manage. 
The heroes should then report back to Teacher Ot and 
Teacher Ulawa, but only when they’ve completed their 
task. The teachers shouldn’t be disturbed lightly. 
While the teachers don’t explicitly state it, the 
heroes should realize that this task is intended to test 
them. This is an opportunity for the heroes to prove 
themselves, and they shouldn’t squander it.
C. Infested Caverns
Several catacombs and classrooms sprawl beneath 
Archhorn Library, though the building hasn’t been 
used for its intended purpose for quite some time. 
Most rooms feature paneling of dry, fragrant wood to 
keep the cold and moisture at bay. Despite being fairly 
spacious and uncluttered, some of the subterranean 
rooms also remained abandoned for years, which 
made them the ideal place for the misanthropic Stone 
Ghost to lair. He drew a number of gremlins into his 
service, including burrowing gnagrif gremlins, and 
hatched his plots of revenge against the school. 
When the Vesicant Egg  began drawing insects 
of all kinds to the Magaambya, the gremlins were 
among the first to realize it, as they possess a kinship 
with vermin. They told Stone Ghost, and he directed 
several insects into the chambers underneath Archhorn 
Library, commanding them with the natural magic he 
had learned, ironically, while a Magaambyan student. 
Now, the gremlins share the caverns with enormous 
insects—predominantly giant mining bees that aid the 
gnagrifs in expanding the cramped natural chambers 
according to Stone Ghost’s commands. 
Stone Ghost expected the attack on the First 
Masking ceremony to be more successful than it 
was, and he didn’t expect the Magaambya to begin 
an immediate and comprehensive exploration of the 
tunnels. He left enough false clues to distract anyone 
exploring underneath Tireless Hall for some time. 
INFESTED CAVERNS FEATURES
The map of Stone Ghost’s insect‑ and gremlin‑infested 
caverns is on the inside back cover of this adventure. 
The passages indicated are only those navigable by the 
heroes; narrow, winding passages that only Tiny or 
smaller creatures can use aren’t indicated on the map 
but let the gremlins move around. 
Even these larger caverns are generally cramped. 
Ceilings in the chambers vary between 6 and 8 feet 
high. In the connecting passages, the ceilings are only 
4 to 5 feet high. Any creature moving through an area 
where the ceiling is shorter than the creature’s height 
treats the area as difficult terrain. 
As most creatures inhabiting these caverns don’t 
need light, the caverns are unlit except where indicated. 
Since the gremlins sometimes wander with candles or 
lanterns they’ve found, light sources the heroes bring 
don’t automatically alert the denizens here.
Droning: The constant drone of the mining bees 
lairing here echoes throughout the infested caverns. 
The pervasive hum masks other sounds; creatures in 
the infested caverns have a +2 circumstance bonus to 
Stealth checks to avoid being overheard. Once all the 
mining bees are defeated, the drone stops.
Active Encounters: Although the room descriptions 
below indicate which creatures are likely there, 
creatures other than Stone Ghost roam around a lot, 
so the heroes might encounter them elsewhere in the 
caverns, at your discretion.
Secret Doors: Stone Ghost has created several secret 
doors throughout the infested caverns. Each is a thin 
sheet of stone that rotates on a hidden peg. These secret 
doors swing closed unless held or spiked open. A hero 
Searching the area of a secret door discovers it with 
a successful DC 17 Perception check. The gremlins 
generally know only those secret doors that lead to the 
rooms where they sleep, but they quickly offer up this 
information if interrogated.

C1. STAGING ROOM  LOW 3
The wooden wall panels in this long, low room have been 
broken apart in four places to reveal narrow passages 
burrowed into the stone. The railing which spans the 
walls and the low rail in the middle hint that this room 
once served as a dance studio. Several desks have been 
relocated here with a few books and papers; more papers 
nailed to the wood near each entrance feature hastily 
sketched maps. 
After this disused room was found to hold many 
recent cavern entrances, the instructors added it to the 
list of tunnels to be explored and mapped. The desks, 
notes, and maps are all evidence of the first group 
that came down here: a cohort of Koride’s favorite 
students who balked at the task when they explored 
a few tunnels and found a much more expansive cave 
system than they’d expected. The bees’ droning caused 
them the most concern, and they convinced Koride to 
reassign them. The students were so quick to leave that 
they left their work here. 
The books and scrolls on the desk are some texts 
about Archhorn Library; Koride’s initial team hoped 
they might give some information or schematics, but 
the infested caverns don’t appear in these old books 
and so aren’t of any use.
The papers tacked to the walls provide sketches 
of the passages to areas C2, C3, and C4. The passage 
between areas C3 and C4 appears on one of the maps 
with a portion of the wall circled with a question mark 
(this mark indicates a secret door in that connecting 
passage, which leads to area C7a). These papers ought 
to give the heroes a good start on their own map of the 
infested caverns.
Creatures: After the heroes have had a chance 
to take a look around this room, but before they 
begin to explore any of the passages, an intensifying 
drone emanates from the passage in the center of 
the south wall. A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 
Nature or Survival check identifies it as the buzzing 
of enormous bees. One round later, two giant mining 
bees fly out of the passage. The gremlins have treated 
them so terribly that they’ve decided to fly off, and 
finding other creatures in their escape route makes 
them both angry and aggressive. They attack the 
heroes immediately. A bee reduced to fewer than 
6 Hit Points flees out into Archhorn Library if the 
heroes haven’t shut the door.
GIANT MINING BEES (2)  CREATURE 2
Page 80
Initiative Perception +9
Treasure: The students who set up this room left 
behind a scroll of dispel magic on one of the tables.
Containing the Gremlins:  If the heroes suspect 
gremlins might be present in the caverns, or if they 
encounter gremlins and retreat here, they might realize 
that this room makes an excellent place for the fey 
abeyance ritual they learned earlier. Casting the ritual 
here prevents the gremlins from easily fleeing the 
caverns and making their way to the surface. When a 
fleeing gremlin gets to the area of the ritual, they sense 
the danger, but they don’t know what kind and they 
don’t want to risk entering it. Any gremlins that flee 
this way simply stop, unsure of where to go, as they 
can sense the detrimental effects the ritual would have 
on them. They surrender to any heroes they see.
If the heroes don’t come up with the idea of using 
the fey abeyance ritual on their own, an NPC they 
speak with might suggest casting it to more easily take 
care of the gremlins. By “take care of” them, people 
like Takulu mean to usher the gremlins off the campus, 
while teachers like Koride probably mean to just kill 
them. The heroes could interpret this suggestion as 
they’d like.
Mundane solutions also exist. For example, the 
heroes might board over these entrances to keep the 
gremlins contained, which also works.
XP Award: If the heroes use the fey abeyance ritual 
here or come up with some other way to keep the 
gremlins from escaping onto the school grounds and 
continue being pests, award them 30 XP.

C2. WET HOLLOW
Both of the southwestern tunnels from area C1 descend 
steeply into this room, as does the tunnel from area 
C3. The room has several puddles of murky, standing 
water that the gremlins drink. Some type of crustacean 
is mostly submerged in one of the puddles; this dead 
vexgit was the victim of other gremlins’ pranks, and 
most of the creature’s head is missing. 
Treasure: The dead vexgit wears a silver ring worth 
40 gp as a bracelet. The heroes find it automatically 
if they remove the creature’s corpse from the puddle.
C3. MASSIVE MUSHROOM
This large, irregular cavern has moisture dripping down the 
walls and a narrow tunnel leading up to the north. A large, 
blue, glowing mushroom faintly illuminates the space.
The large glowing mushroom is a spontaneous 
manifestation of the Magaambya’s primal magic. It 
has grown here for many years, getting larger and 
larger; now it’s roughly the size and width of a dwarf. 
The mushroom has plainly been gnawed at a bit, but 
the gremlins found it unappetizing and leave it alone. 
A hero who succeeds at a DC 15 Nature check knows 
that it isn’t harmful; on a critical success, the hero 
realizes that eating it will aid primal spellcasters. 
The mushroom bears a strange enchantment that 
interacts with those capable of casting primal spells. 
Anyone eating a piece of the mushroom is imbued with 
restorative magic. For the next hour, when the imbiber 
casts a non‑cantrip primal spell that targets only one 
creature, they can choose to restore 1d6 Hit Points per 
spell level to the target in addition to the spell’s normal 
effects; this is a healing effect. A creature can only gain 
this benefit from the mushroom once per day.
C4. CENTIPEDE TRAPS  MODERATE 3
Three centipede carcasses lie on the floor near the south 
end of this room. Each appears to be curled around a ball 
of string or wire, like a kitten with a ball of yarn. 
This chamber used to be a centipede nest, but Stone 
Ghost used all the centipedes in the attack on the 
auditorium. The three left behind here were killed in 
the gremlins’ fervent whipping to goad the rest of the 
centipedes to attack. Rather than let the dead bugs go 
to waste, they scooped out all the centipede meat for 
food and prepared a trap inside each exoskeleton.
Koride’s initial explorers made it as far as this room, 
but they didn’t investigate the dead centipedes, so all 
three traps are still armed. 
Hazard: The gremlins curled each giant centipede 
carcass around a tight ball of springy wire. The wire 
is tied to the centipede’s legs, which the gremlins have 
sharpened even further into deadly points. When the 
carcass is jostled, the wire starts to unspring, pulling 
out the centipede legs and flinging them around the 
room. All of the centipede’s legs are pulled free from 
the carcass after 1 minute of unspooling. 
There are three centipede traps. When one is 
triggered, the legs it flings jostle the other two traps, 
so almost immediately, all three traps are hurling 
sharpened centipede legs around the room. Multiple 
traps don’t do any more damage to people in the room 
than just one trap—a character can be hit by only so 
many sharpened centipede legs each turn—but all 
three traps need to be disarmed or expended before 
the room is safe.
CENTIPEDE CARCASSES TRAP  HAZARD 5
COMPLEX MECHANICAL TRAP

Description Three giant centipede carcasses have wire 
springs that pull out and fling their sharpened legs 
around the room.
Disable DC 23 Nature (trained) to bend the centipede 
carapace so the wire can’t pull out any more legs, or DC 
21 Thievery (expert) to cut the springy wires. After all 
three carcasses are disabled (regardless of the check 
used), the trap is deactivated. The trap automatically 
deactivates after 10 rounds.

Carcass Hardness 12; Carcass HP 20 (BT 10); Immunities 
critical hits, object immunities, precision damage. 
Volley of Legs [reaction] Trigger A carcass is touched or jostled; 
Effect Each creature within 30 feet of any centipede 
carcass takes 4d4 piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex 
save), and the area becomes difficult terrain due to the 
many sharpened legs on the ground. Each creature that 
Strides more than 10 feet through the area must succeed 
at a DC 20 Acrobatics check or take 1d4 piercing damage. 
The trap then rolls initiative.
Routine (1 action) Each creature within 30 feet of a 
centipede carcass that hasn’t been disabled takes 6d4 
piercing damage (DC 22 basic Reflex save).
C5. MINING TUNNELS  MODERATE 3
This room has broken carapaces of giant bee drones 
heaped into its corners and reeks of the sickly-sweet smell 
of decay. Three recent tunnels lead northeast.
Stone Ghost has commanded the gremlins to dig 
new tunnels northeast from this area to reach other

sublevels of the Magaambya’s buildings. Gnagrifs and 
mining bees have only begun this work; the tunnels 
don’t yet go anywhere. The work is particularly 
difficult on mining bees, who are poorly suited to 
digging through stone, but the gremlins work the bees 
hard regardless. When a bee dies from its efforts, the 
gremlins just stack its body on the piles, which are now 
crawling with tiny carrion insects enjoying the feast.
Creatures: Two gnagrifs gnaw slowly but diligently 
through the rock, one in each of the longest tunnels. 
A tired mining bee is in the third tunnel; without a 
gremlin urging it to work, it just rests and tries to 
remain out of sight.
These creatures generally ignore any activity in the 
larger cave; they have a –4 penalty to Perception checks 
for initiative if surprised. If the bee is bothered, it fights 
back, and the gremlins rush out to join it in a fight. If 
either of the gremlins realize there are intruders, they 
shout, bringing the other gremlin to attack. The bee 
only joins the fight if attacked or if one of the gremlins 
takes the time to cast speak with animals and demand 
that it participate.
The tenacious gnagrifs fight to the death, but the bee 
flees as soon as it takes any damage, buzzing back to 
area C9. The heroes might encounter it alongside the 
other mining bees there.

C6. PUDDLES AND MOLD  LOW 3
Several wide, shallow puddles cover the floor of this cool, 
moist cavern. Thick brown fungus covers a natural pillar in 
the northwest part of this room.
As this room contains two troublesome but 
stationary dangers, the gremlins move quickly through 
here on the rare occasions they traverse it. They know 
not to bring any fire near the pillar.
Hazard: The fungus on the pillar is a patch of brown 
mold. Anyone approaching the pillar realizes it’s the 
source of the chill in the air since the temperature 
drops near it.
BROWN MOLD HAZARD 2
Gamemastery Guide 77
Stealth DC 21 
Creature: One of the puddles near the cave’s south 
end is actually a gray ooze, which generally waits 
patiently for prey to step into it before attacking. 
It’s not close enough to the brown mold to take cold 
damage from it when the mold leeches warmth; if the 
brown mold expands, the gray ooze nevertheless feels 
the wave of cold, which prompts it to lurch forth to 
attack the heroes. The gray ooze fights until destroyed, 
pursuing prey as well as its Speed permits.

C7 . NEST ROOMS VARIABLE 3
All four gremlin nest rooms (areas C7a, C7b, C7c, and 
C7d) are similar.
This filthy room is jammed with hammocks, blankets, and 
bedrolls, all heaped into makeshift nests for little creatures. 
Discarded bits of food, twisted lumps of metal, and bits of 
stone litter the floor.
These nest areas are concealed by secret doors (page 
48). Exhausted from their work, gremlins sleep deeply 
and require loud noise or vigorous shaking to awaken.
Creatures: As the gremlins sleep irregularly and in 
whichever nest room they like, the number and type of 
gremlins in these rooms aren’t fixed. There’s a 1 in 3 
chance that one of these nest rooms has any gremlins 
in it at all; if it does, the heroes find 1d4 sleeping 
gremlins. Roll 1d4 on the table below to determine the 
type of gremlin, or just choose the type.
Gremlins roused from their sleep are irritable and 
prone to attack; if presented with obviously superior 
enemies, a gremlin either flees in the opposite direction 
(all the nest rooms have two exits for this purpose) or 
surrenders if flight seems impossible. Fleeing gremlins 
try to meet up in areas C5 or C10 and alert the gremlins 
there to trouble.

The heroes know these people: Ignaci, Okoro, and 
Tzeniwe. This cohort was assigned to map the areas 
beneath Warden House, next to Archhorn Library, but 
a cave‑in blocked their way back. They don’t realize 
they’ve followed the twisting tunnels outside their 
assigned area, and recently ran into the giant mining 
bees in area C9. While trying to look brave in front of 
Okoro, Ignaci got stung by a bee and learned, quite 
dramatically, that he has a severe allergy to bee stings. 
Ignaci’s skin has broken out into hives and his tongue 
and throat are swollen. Okoro and Tzeniwe are too 
worried about his sudden symptoms to move him, and 
neither has the medical knowledge to help him. If left 
unaided, Ignaci could die. 
The heroes can help if they can calm the frantic 
cohort and treat Ignaci. A hero can calm the trio with 
a successful DC 18 Diplomacy or Intimidation check, 
although you might allow other means to calm them 
with a similar DC. Once the attendants have calmed 
down, the heroes can either help them get Ignaci safely 
to the surface or treat him directly. A hero can treat 
Ignaci with a successful DC 20 Medicine check. The 
heroes can retry this check on a failure, but the DC 
increases by 2 each time. On a success, Ignaci is well 
enough that Okoro and Tzeniwe can get him to the 
surface without the heroes’ help if the heroes describe 
a safe way up through Archhorn Library (as the 
cave‑in blocks the path back up to Warden House). On 
a critical success, the hero quells Ignaci’s symptoms 
entirely and he can walk unaided, though Okoro 
and Tzeniwe escort him to the surface anyway. On a 
critical failure, Ignaci goes into shock; unless a hero 
succeeds at another DC 20 Medicine check within 1 
round, he dies.
The tunnel off the map to the west now leads to 
a large collapse and several dead‑end tunnels. They 
don’t contain anything of interest other than a few 
tracks from insects and gremlins coming and going. 
Tzeniwe spotted the secret door across this room 
(that leads to area C10), but the last thing her group 
wanted to do was poke into secret chambers. Once 
the heroes have provided her group with any help, 
Tzeniwe tells them about the secret door.
XP Award: If the heroes calm the group to help 
Ignaci, award them 30 XP. If they thereafter save 
Ignaci with a successful Medicine check, award them 
an additional 80 XP. They also earn Ignaci’s gratitude 
for saving his life. 
C9. IRRITATED HIVE  MODERATE 3
This natural chamber has strangely sticky walls. The air is 
filled with a heavy scent vaguely reminiscent of flowers.
This room is the hive of the giant mining bees drawn 
here by the Vesicant Egg. The gremlins corral all the 
giant mining bees into this one chamber—they don’t 
realize that mining bees are generally solitary and 
don’t like living in close quarters with each other. The 
sticky mess on the walls is a paste made of tree sap and 
crushed flowers, which the gremlins have determined, 
through trial and error, that the mining bees will eat.
Sticky Walls: Creatures will have difficultly moving 
through the room without brushing against the sticky 
sap. Any creature moving farther than 15 feet in a 
single Move action must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex 
save at the end of its movement or take a –10‑foot 
penalty to its Speeds until the end of its next turn (this 
Speed penalty isn’t cumulative). Mining bees aren’t 
slowed by the sap.
Creatures: Three mining bees live in this hive; they’re 
currently in opposite parts of the chamber to avoid 
each other’s company. The students now hiding out in 
area C8 have already irritated the bees, who are now 
antagonistic and ready to attack anyone other than 
gremlins. A mining bee reduced to fewer than 6 Hit 
Points flees from the heroes as fast and as far as it can, 
which might alert the caverns’ other denizens to trouble.

C10. WAR ROOM  MODERATE 3
A table bearing a large cloth map pinned down with heavy 
rocks along the edges occupies much of this room. Though 
dirty and tattered, the aged map provides a detailed view of 
the Magaambya campus. Drawn atop the map are several 
caves and tunnels, creating a connected web of passages 
between the buildings.
Aside from the large map on the table, the heroes 
find little of use here. The table is stout wood and 
set 2 feet off the floor on heavy wooden legs. There 
isn’t enough room for Small or larger creatures to fit 
comfortably beneath it, but the gremlins can scurry 
under the table with ease and use it to gain cover from 
larger creatures.
The map is the property of the Magaambya; 
Kurshkin stole it to more easily plan with Stone 
Ghost. They’ve since covered the map with 
scribblings, partially completed schemes, and notes 
in a mishmash of Common, Undercommon, and 
Terran. Even though the plans are indecipherable, they 
plainly depict targeted attacks on the Magaambya. 
Anyone examining the map can see that the storage

room and outdoor Introduction Ceremony site are 
circled, as are the Tree‑Stump Library and Tireless 
Hall—all locations that Stone Ghost’s minions have 
targeted. Many of the abandoned tunnels beneath the 
school are marked on the map, too, with the hatch 
leading to the Spire Dormitory circled with a note in 
Undercommon reading, “They Live Here. Send Urbel 
to kill them.” Urbel is Kurshkin’s brutish enforcer. He 
doesn’t particularly relish going alone into a dorm full 
of magic‑trained students, so he has been putting off 
Kurshkin’s command to venture out and eliminate the 
heroes. The heroes most likely find Urbel in area C13. 
Creatures: Five gremlins are trying to decipher the 
instructions on the map in this room. Stymied by a 
combination of their limited experience with maps 
and the unclear notes, they haven’t had much luck. 
Each instead argues that their own interest should be 
what the gremlins pursue as a whole. They have a –2 
penalty to Perception checks for initiative if caught 
mid‑argument, since they aren’t paying much attention 
to anything else. Once the gremlins spot intruders, they 
quickly shout in alarm and attack. When fighting bigger 
creatures, they prefer to dart under the planning table 
for protection.
The gremlins include a blunt‑snouted and 
pugnacious gnagrif who wants to focus on 
digging, a gangly jinkin who thinks cursing the 
Magaambya’s magic is the best next step, and 
three warty mitflits who urge another insect 
attack (despite the fact that the last one 
didn’t succeed and cost them their most 
powerful insects). There’s a sixth gremlin 
here who isn’t part of the planning: a 
lice‑infested grimple gremlin named Binji 
who the other gremlins all boss around 
as their servant. She’s currently 
trying to scrub insect entrails off 
of a knife in a corner of the room. 
Binji tries to stay out of the way 
during a fight so she can talk to the 
heroes afterwards. 
If Kurshkin survived the attack in 
Chapter 1, she’s also here trying to 
maintain order, making for a Severe 
encounter.

So Many Lice The prevalence of insects on the Magaambya 
campus means Binji is more infested with gremlin lice 
than most grimples. The Reflex DC to avoid infestation 
from her gremlin lice is 15 rather than 13.
Lots of Noise:  If the fight here was particularly 
noisy, and if you determined that there are any 
gremlins currently in area C7b, the noise wakes them 
up. Rather than rushing to join the combat, however, 
the gremlins hide in their nests and prepare to ambush 
anyone who comes by. 
Befriending Binji:  Binji has had enough of her 
mistreatment at the hands of the other gremlins. 
Turning herself over to the big folk who bested 
Kurshkin seems like a safe bet to her. She hides 
while the heroes fight the other gremlins 
but comes out afterwards, nervously 
wringing her hands together on 
the hem of her burlap tunic. Binji 
makes a simple offer: she’ll aid the 
heroes if they protect her from the 
other gremlins and take her away 
with them when they leave. Until 
then, she dutifully tags behind 
the heroes, haphazardly tidying 
up their messes and doing her 
best to be helpful. If the heroes want her 
to stay put someplace, she does so only 
if one of the heroes succeeds at a DC 18 
Diplomacy check to convince her they 
won’t just abandon her. 
So long as Binji accompanies the 
heroes, she notes when they’re 
coming up on an area where 
the other gremlins are likely to 
be, and she identifies any secret 
doors the party passes by. As Binji has been

nor properly dead, and she discourages the heroes 
from having anything to do with him.
Treasure: One of the paperweights on the map is a 
lump of amber worth 35 gp. Secured beneath the map 
table are three lesser healing potions . The gremlins 
don’t think to use the potions in the heat of battle, 
but they’ll remember to drink them if the heroes 
retreat from a fight here. Anyone Searching the room 
discovers the cache of potions with a successful DC 14 
Perception check.
XP Award: If the heroes recover the map detailing 
Stone Ghost’s plans, award them 30 XP. Award 
them an additional 80 XP for treating Binji well and 
agreeing to lead her somewhere safe. 
C11. PANTRY
Though likely once organized, this storage area has been 
pillaged over and over again, leaving barrels pried or 
punched open and sacks spilling their contents across the 
grimy floor. Piles of garbage flood the corners. A small 
cook fire has stained the ceiling with soot, and the nearby 
utensils seem to have never seen wash water.
Binji usually works here, trying hard to keep the 
room orderly while the other gremlins simply take 
what they want and leave messes for her to clean up. 
Treasure: A bag just visible at the top of one of 
the shelves, well out of easy gremlin reach, is a bag 
of holding type I. It contains a taxidermy bloodseeker 
missing its beak and, perhaps unsurprisingly, a 
bloodseeker beak.
C12. BINJI’S BEDROLL
This intersection has a wad of blankets pushed up 
against one wall, out of the way. Tiny bugs crawl all over 
the blankets.
None of the other gremlins want Binji to bunk 
with them, so she sleeps in this out‑of‑the‑way nook. 
Her blankets are crawling with gremlin lice; anyone 
touching the blankets must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex 
save or become infested (as with Binji’s Gremlin Lice 
ability). The beleaguered gremlin has nothing of value 
in her blankets beyond a few poorly carved figurines 
that she considers her only friends.
C13. TRAINING GROUND  MODERATE 3
The smell of rotten meat assails the senses in this large 
cavern. A natural pillar in the middle of the room bears 
several metal hooks with gruesome slabs of meat hanging 
from each.
Kurshkin’s chief enforcer, the nuglub bully Urbel, is 
usually found here. He’s supposed to be planning an 
assassination attempt against the students of the Spire 
Dormitory or helping with the mining, but neither 
of these tasks interests him much. With Kurshkin 
gone (either defeated by the heroes or too busy with 
planning in area C10), Urbel spends his time trying to 
teach a giant tsetse fly to serve as his mount.
Creatures: Urbel and the giant fly are both clearly 
irritated. Since Urbel doesn’t really know much about 
training animals, he simply wrestles himself atop the 
fly with the hopes that it’ll learn to be a loyal mount. 
This approach hasn’t worked. All it has done is teach 
the fly to buck him off and make it ill‑tempered.
When Urbel spots the heroes, he grunts in 
Undercommon, “Yer making my job easy by coming 
to me.” He draws his weapon and attempts to climb 
atop the giant fly. The fly tries to buck him off 
immediately, but if Urbel hangs on, he shouts with 
triumph and commands the fly to charge the heroes. 
If Urbel is bucked off, he simply lumbers into combat 
directly. Urbel prefers to attack prone targets; if the 
heroes don’t provoke his Kneecapper reaction, he tries 
to Shove them. If a hero lands a solid hit on him, Urbel 
usually takes his first action to Demoralize that hero 
with a frightful lunge and grunt. Urbel fights until 
reduced to fewer than 15 Hit Points, at which point he 
throws down his pick and flees.
The aggressive giant fly prefers to attack animals if 
any are present, but it generally focuses its attacks on 
whoever hurt it most recently. If Urbel is reduced to 
fewer than 30 Hit Points, the fly dimly realizes that 
it has an opportunity to pay back all its mistreatment 
at the gremlin’s hands. It starts attacking Urbel 
rather than the heroes, which makes Urbel groan in 
frustration as he must split up his attacks between the 
heroes and the traitorous fly.
CAN WE KEEP HER?
If your players decide to keep Binji around upon 
completing their agreement, she happily helps them 
in any capacity they’d like, so long as she doesn’t 
have to frequent crowded or noisy places. She can be 
an assistant, study partner, spy, or even combatant, 
though she’s objectively bad at fighting. The faculty 
doesn’t mind Binji’s presence, so long as the heroes 
agree to be responsible for and kind to her; other 
students have kept stranger companions, to be sure. 
Binji’s lice likely won’t win the heroes any favors, as the 
irritating bugs get into any space Binji sleeps or works.

C14. GRUESOME TROPHIES
Three masks and three cloaks are affixed to the south 
wall of this claustrophobic cave, as 
though in mockery of people, with 
arms extended to the sides. All 
look colorful, but dirty and bloodstained. One of 
the masks depicts a stern antelope, another a 
kindly hare, and the last a smiling warthog.
The cloaks and masks are grim trophies 
of Magaambyans that Stone Ghost murdered 
some time ago; he likes to admire these 
trophies and reflect on his kills when he 
comes and goes from his room.
One of the outfits—the hare mask 
and a bloodstained cloak in yellow and 
white—has been affixed to the secret door to the 
south that leads to Stone Ghost’s room. Hanging the 
mask and cloak in that spot makes the secret door 
sit slightly askew on its hinges, reducing the DC to 
discover it to 13. Furthermore, anyone looking over 
the outfit can attempt a Perception check to discover 
the secret door, even if they aren’t actively Searching 
that area.
Anyone looking over the cloaks can attempt a DC 
15 Nature or Survival check. On a success, dirt and 
dust on the lower half of the cloaks indicates that 
each wearer was somehow pulled partially into the 
ground before being killed. This clue hints at one of 
Stone Ghost’s abilities, which the heroes might shortly 
witness firsthand!
Treasure: The mask of the kindly hare is a mask of 
mercy (page 74). Takulu can help a hero transfer the 
abilities of this mask to a non‑magical mask in a hero’s 
possession (such as the mask they constructed during 
the First Masking) if they choose; doing so takes 1 day 
of downtime.
XP Award:  No one at the school realizes that 
these students have died, much less that Stone Ghost 
killed them. Returning their masks allows them to 
be honored and remembered appropriately. Award 
the heroes 30 XP for bringing the masks back to 
the school.

C15. STONE GHOST’S ROOM  SEVERE 3
This well-appointed bedroom and study almost makes 
one forget that it’s hidden deep underground. The space 
is neatly furnished with mismatched items, including a 
bearskin rug and extraordinarily comfortable-looking chair. 
A heavy professor’s desk sits off to one side, along with a 
massive, gently scuffed four-poster bed. Rugs and curtains 
hang in an inadequate attempt to make the space seem 
less like a cave, but craggy wall peeks through the gaps.
Stone Ghost keeps his room remarkably clean. 
Most of the furniture looks barely touched; no dust 
sits on anything, and the bed is neatly made. The only 
exception is the desk, which bears several papers and 
journals and obviously sees frequent use. A large clay 
jug of water sits on the desk as well.
Creatures: Stone Ghost spends his time planning here. 
If he’s unaware of the party’s presence in the tunnels, the 
heroes find him diligently working at his desk, perfecting 
his schemes. More likely, due to fleeing gremlins or 
the cessation of the omnipresent buzzing, Stone Ghost 
suspects intruders. Once he has reason to think someone 
is approaching his room, he enters one of the walls 
behind a hanging tapestry and waits, peeking an ear 
out occasionally to hear whether anyone has entered 
his room. Detecting Stone Ghost’s careful concealment 
requires a character to succeed at a DC 25 Perception 
check. If undetected, he listens to what the heroes do. So 
long as they don’t get near his desk or discuss his notes—
which he knows are very incriminating—he remains 
hidden and hopes they go away. If they move over to 
the desk, discuss him by name, or mention any of the 
Magaambya teachers, he decides to kill them to protect 
the secret of his presence here.
Two jinkin gremlins also hide underneath the bed, 
tinkering with a magic mask they’re trying to curse. They 
know that Stone Ghost doesn’t like them making a lot of 
noise, so they remain quiet, whether or not they know the 
heroes are present. Once they know there are intruders in 
the room, they wait to attack until Stone Ghost attacks 
first. A jinkin reduced to fewer than 10 Hit Points flees 
and doesn’t return, and both gremlins flee immediately if 
Stone Ghost is defeated.
To protect his notes, Stone Ghost steps away from 
the wall and swings his morningstar (he’s slowed

1 on a round where he starts his turn inside a wall) 
while calling for the gremlins to attack. In subsequent 
rounds, Stone Ghost uses his spells and his Entombing 
Grasp ability to incapacitate the heroes and club them 
to death. His favorite tactic is to pull someone into the 
ground, then clobber them with his morningstar. Stone 
Ghost doesn’t ask for surrender or give it, as he’s too 
proud and stubborn to do something so crude as beg 
for his life in the face of defeat. However, if he thinks 
his defeat is imminent, he casts shatter on the water 
jug on the desk, dousing all the incriminating notes so 
that no one can learn his plans.

Stone Ghost’s Notes:  It takes several minutes to 
sort through all the incriminating journals, maps, and 
notes on the desk. If Stone Ghost managed to shatter 
the water jug, the notes are indecipherable unless a 
hero succeeds at a DC 20 Nature or Society check to 
Decipher Writing, and the laborious reconstruction 
takes hours. Unfortunately for Stone Ghost, the water 
doesn’t wholly obliterate this evidence.
The notes and maps concern the Magaambya 
grounds, including access tunnels, subterranean 
rooms, and other underground places Stone Ghost was 
attempting to reach by digging. These maps include 
the access tunnels under the campus that the heroes 
might have discovered through the maintenance hatch 
in the Spire Dormitory. The journals detail Stone 
Ghost’s plans. 
Some older notes are by an “Uduak Basni,” Stone 
Ghost’s old name before he took the title the gremlins 
gave him. More recent notes indicate surprise at the 
number of insects found on the campus, followed by 
delight when he realized that digging insects could help 
create a network of interconnected tunnels beneath the 
school. One note in particular reads, “Not clear why 
so many insects are drawn to campus, but the gremlins 
do fine at keeping them in line. I have the gremlins 
working the insects to death, to take their little minds 
off of the fact I’m doing the same to them.” The insect 
attack on Tireless Hall is just the first of several attack 
plans detailed in these notes, each aiming to inflict 
greater damage and death upon the Magaambya.
Leaderless Denizens: Once the heroes have defeated 
Stone Ghost, the surviving gremlins in the caverns 
begin to clear out, as they no longer have anyone to 
command them and fear retribution from the magic 
school if they stay. Within a day or so, all the gremlins 
have relocated elsewhere. Unless the heroes managed 
to capture them, they might cause trouble in isolated 
places on campus in subsequent adventures.
The insects don’t leave and, in fact, become healthier 
once they aren’t being worked so hard by the gremlins. 
If relocated, they eventually return due to the Vesicant 
Egg still calling to them.
Treasure: The jinkins under the bed haven’t 
yet cursed the rhinoceros mask  (page 74) they’re 
tinkering with. Its enchantment can be transferred to a 
non‑magical mask just like the mask of mercy in area 
C14. The bearskin rug is exceptionally well made and 
is worth 30 gp.
XP Award: Award the heroes 30 XP if they learn 
what’s in Stone Ghost’s notes.
Exploration Aftermath
When the heroes have defeated Stone Ghost and 
finished mapping the caverns, they can return to Takulu 
and Koride. The area in front of Tireless Hall has been 
turned into an enormous field station, with insects 
of all sizes being hauled outside and sorted. Koride 
oversees the investigation, labeling and cataloguing 
the creatures in the aftermath of this mysterious 
invasion, while students provide her with samples and 
reports. Takulu meets the heroes and takes any maps 
or notes they offer, but he knows they’ve already been 
through a lot.
“We will be working on solutions for hours, maybe days,” 
Teacher Ot says with a kindly smile. “There will be time 
for you to give me a complete report of your findings 
tomorrow morning. For now, I’m giving you an important 
assignment—go home and rest.”
Treasure: If Ignaci survived, he’s recovering well 
after receiving the heroes’ aid. In gratitude, he offers to 
make the heroes any two common alchemical elixirs 
of 5th level or less that they choose.
Anadi Arrival  ........................ Extreme 3
When the heroes return to the field station the next 
day, Koride and Takulu are still there, having worked 
through the night. They’ve made several important 
discoveries. Koride isn’t willing to talk about them, 
even to students she likes; she has started to worry that 
the Vesicant Egg, which she had been secretly studying, 
is somehow responsible, though she isn’t ready to 
admit that to anyone just yet. Takulu, on the other 
hand, is eager to share information with the heroes

as they inform him about their cavern explorations 
in more detail. He listens intently to the heroes, and 
provides them these findings during the conversation. 
First, the insects were drawn by some pervasive yet 
persistent psychic call. 
Second, gremlins, pests, and other creatures that 
aren’t strictly insects (like spiders) have responded 
to the call as well. Of course, they’ve been closely 
questioned. None can provide any details other than 
experiencing a strange longing, and a sense that they 
must go to the Magaambya.
Third, the emanation is virtually undetectable but 
seems to be ongoing. The heroes have defeated the 
villain weaponizing the infestations, but they aren’t 
over. The emanation isn’t localized, so pinpointing its 
source is impossible without more work or some new 
angle of discovery.
When the conversation with Takulu winds down, 
Esi rushes up to inform him that three prospective 
students seeking admission have just arrived. She 
suggests, a bit uncomfortably, that they’re likely to 
cause a disturbance unless someone speaks with them 
right away. If pressed, Esi explains that the visitors are 
anadis. Esi doesn’t mind anadis, as she’s good friends 
with Tzeniwe and her children, but she knows that not 
everyone is comfortable with the spider ‑like people. 
Takulu thanks Esi and dismisses her. He asks the 
heroes to come with him to meet these visitors.
The three anadi seekers are in the open area near the 
Speaker’s Stage while a few students keep a cautious 
distance. Rather than traveling in human form, as is 
typical for anadis, they’re each in their hybrid forms. 
This behavior demonstrates that they’re likely new to 
the area and thus unfamiliar with Nantambu customs 
or opinions about anadis, which a hero who succeeds 
at a DC 15 Society check realizes.
Takulu strides forward to greet the three visitors, who look 
around with wonder in their many eyes. “Welcome and 
a kind hello, new friends. It is my pleasure to greet you 
today. You may call me Teacher Ot.”
“Teacher Ot, we would learn from you and from the school. 
We humbly submit ourselves as pupils.” All three anadis bow 
respectfully. “I am Rainbows-Reflected-Upon-Gossamer-
Strands, who is called Goss. This is Droplets-Hanging-Gently 
Savanakin and Barest-Threads-Billowing Maztachia. We 
have some small knowledge of magic already. Presenting 
ourselves without sponsorship is highly irregular, we know, 
but we all feel as though the Magaambya is…the place we 
must be. Something is calling us here, Teacher Ot.”
Teacher Ot looks meaningfully back to your group before 
responding, “We welcome the new angles of discovery that 
your presence will bring. I would like to introduce you 
to some of our most recent students. They have already 
distinguished themselves and might provide you with—”
Before Teacher Ot can finish, the nearby students shout 
and scatter. Three large forms soar across the canal from 
the city, screeching loudly.
Three griffons have been stalking the anadis as they 
moved through Nantambu. Recently escaped from 
an animal merchant, the hungry creatures consider 
spiders tasty and decide to make a meal of them. The 
griffons are visually striking, with blackbird heads and 
feline leopard bodies. They all look underfed and are 
obviously quite hungry. 
Although everyone else in the area scatters, Takulu 
grips his staff and prepares to defend the three anadi 
seekers. He hopes the heroes choose to do so as well, 
knowing that he can’t handle the griffons on his own.
Three griffons pose an Extreme challenge for the 
heroes, but they aren’t alone; Takulu and the anadi 
seekers all fight. Still, the heroes must face off with 
powerful foes. As the griffons target the anadis, who 
aren’t very tough, it’s possible that one or two of them 
might be killed in this fight. If the heroes try to protect 
the anadis, have the griffons attack the heroes instead 
to show that their efforts at defense are meaningful. 
In any event, at least one anadi should survive, as 
these newcomers have a role to play in unraveling the 
mystery of the Vesicant Egg in the next adventure.
Creatures: The griffons begin combat by making 
Flying Strafe attacks, attacking one anadi and one 
hero (or Takulu) each time they do. A wounded griffon 
lands to fight with its beak and wings. Once two 
griffons are defeated, the third flies off only if reduced 
to fewer than 20 Hit Points. 
Takulu aids the heroes as best he can, providing them 
Quick Lessons to aid their attacks and administering his 
healing potion and spells to injured heroes. The anadis 
have little to bring to bear other than color spray and 
magic missile, but they try to make these attacks count. 
They know that staying in melee range of a griffon is a 
death sentence, so they avoid doing so at all costs.

Treasure: The anadis don’t know where the griffons 
came from—the heroes can solve this mystery in the 
next adventure—but they’re grateful for the timely 
assistance. They provide the heroes a silk dancing scarf 
in gratitude.
Conclusion
Once the griffons have either been killed or subdued, 
life in the Magaambya can return to some semblance 
of normal. If any griffons survived, Takulu asks 
for Ahassunu, an iruxi lore‑speaker with a love of 
predatory animals, to take charge of them.
The next day, Takulu Ot asks the heroes to join 
him in his office to discuss everything that transpired 
in the caverns. If they’ve yet to give him the map 
from area C10 or Stone Ghost’s notes from area 
C15, they can give those to him now. If the notes 
are waterlogged, Takulu casts mending  and uses 
his experience with book restoration to fix them, 
making it something of an impromptu lesson for 
the heroes. 
Upon reviewing the notes, Takulu makes the 
connection with Uduak Basni right away. Takulu 
shakes his head and sighs.
“This ‘Stone Ghost’ you encountered was once Uduak 
Basni. He was an initiate, but he felt he did not need to 
earn power or give back to the community. He came to 
resent that he was asked to prove himself. He grew cruel. 
Uduak slaughtered a mischievous gang of gremlins and 
was temporarily detained until we could decide whether 
to expel him. During his imprisonment, a spell he cast in 
an attempt to escape backfired and, we believed then, 
killed him. It is strange that he survived, but stranger 
still that gremlins flocked to his side. I assume fear 
played a large part in that.”
Takulu asks the heroes to fill in anything that 
he might have missed. He realizes that Uduak’s 
presence explains the gremlins, and he certainly 
maintined control over the insects, but nothing 
about Uduak’s story or his notes explains what has 
drawn so many insects to the Magaambya in the 
first place. 
“I fear we have moved beyond my expertise, but do 
not worry. I know someone who may have more 
insight. Janatimo was my mentor, just as I am yours. 
He is one of the Magaambya’s cleverest lore-speakers, 
though he rarely stays in one place for long. I would like 
to gain his wisdom and, to be honest, introduce your 
impressive group to him. We will discuss with him in 
person the next time he returns. In the meantime, thank 
you for all you have done.” Takulu gives a warm smile 
as he stands to signal the end of the meeting. “We will 
speak again soon.”
The heroes have some time to reflect on what 
they’ve learned, as the Vesicant Egg’s threat remains 
both subtle and inexorable, for now. The Strength 
of Thousands campaign continues with Janatimo’s 
return in Pathfinder Adventure Path #170: Spoken on 
the Song Wind.
