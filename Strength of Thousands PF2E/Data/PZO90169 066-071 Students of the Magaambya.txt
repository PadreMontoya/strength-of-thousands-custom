Lessons are important, but the school experience is 
also defined by the peers who study alongside one 
another. This article presents nine fellow students of 
the Magaambya who learn and grow with the heroes. 
Although most of these students 
have roles in “Kindled Magic” 
and later adventures, feel free to 
develop attachments, rivalries, or 
even romances as matches your 
group’s interests and comfort. 
Each student is presented with 
a short stat block that details 
their branch, hobbies, quirks, 
and so on. Each also presents 
two important benefits. The first, 
Classroom Advantage, benefits parties 
who are good friends with the student 
when they attempt the Study or Cram 
downtime activities (page 63) in certain 
classes or circumstances, as specified in 
the student’s entry. The second benefit 
is an uncommon rules item, such as a 
spell, which the heroes gain access to 
once they’ve befriended the student. It’s up 
to you how close the relationship must be before the 
heroes gain these benefits and how they can build 
a friendship with a student, whether by improving 
a student’s attitude mechanically with successful 
Diplomacy checks, performing good deeds or favors 
throughout the campaign, or merely showing genuine 
interest and friendship.
ANCHOR ROOT
N | female | ant gnoll | bonekeeper-in-training
Branch: Rain-Scribes
Classroom Advantage: Treat your critical failures when you 
Study for Rain-Scribe classes as failures instead.
Specialty Item: rhythm bone (page 76)
Notable Skills: Nature, Occultism, Stealth, Survival
Hobbies: sand sculptures, raising beetles, musical curation
Most Well Known For:  interrupting herself halfway 
through a presentation to exclaim “I’m sorry, I’m boring 
you” and running out of the room crying
Strangest Quirk: uses a chicken tied to a stick to 
keep her room free of unwanted bugs
Common Associates:  Esi (working on music 
playback magic), Noxolo (scavenging bones), 
Tzeniwe (stress baking)
Anchor Root is an ant gnoll, a 3-foot-tall 
humanoid who resembles an aardwolf 
more than a deadly carnivore. 
She hails from the small Redridge 
clan, several weeks’ travel south-west 
from the Magaambya. Her clan has 
been in decline for several decades, 
with important storytellers and 
religious leaders dying before 
suitable replacements could be 
trained. Anchor Root is the only child 
in the clan with the potential talent 
to replace Redridge’s aging bonekeeper. 
Anchor Root’s entire family has placed 
their hopes on the young gnoll—unfortunately, 
Anchor Root’s temperament is ill-suited to such 
pressure. Though she has always had issues with 
anxiety, the expectations currently placed on her 
shoulders have left her in a constant state of panic. 
The slightest flaw in her work or actions, whether 
real or perceived, can leave Anchor Root a devastated 
wreck for days. 
Anchor Root takes her role as bonekeeper-in-training 
very seriously, even though she isn’t sure she’s up to 
the task. She is always on the lookout for the bones 
of worthy creatures—gnolls or otherwise—that can be 
symbolically adopted by her troubled clan to serve as 
spiritual mentors and protectors. The gnoll also has a 
hobby of anonymously recording music played around 
the city and then working with other students to play 
back the music on campus for others to hear.

CHIZIRE
CN | male | catfolk | slacker
Branch: Cascade Bearers
Classroom Advantage: You don’t get tired after you Cram 
for Cascade Bearer classes.
Specialty Spell: verminous lure (page 76)
Notable Skills:  Crafting, Deception, 
Diplomacy, Nature
Hobbies: brewing, engineering, 
finding new and exciting ways to 
avoid work
Most Well Known For:  building a 
complete moonshine still in his dorm 
room from scrap
Strangest Quirk:  always knowing the 
answer when called on despite visibly 
sleeping through class
Common Associates: Haibram (drinking 
partner), Ignaci (brewing experimental 
elixirs), Mariama (brewing weird liquors), Okoro 
(gaming group)
Chizire spent most of his youth in 
Kibwe unable to read, no matter how 
many books he was given or how many 
lessons were drilled into his head. By the 
time a visiting scholar encountered Chizire 
and recognized the youth was dyslexic, Chizire had 
already embraced the role of slacker and screw-up 
that had been thrust upon him. Despite this, Chizire’s 
keen ability to teach himself magic and 
science caught the scholar’s eye, even if 
the catfolk mostly used his gifts to keep 
slugs out of his fermentation barrels.
Chizire thrives at the Magaambya, 
though he often uses his intelligence 
for disruptive jokes, complex pranks, 
and other hijinks disapproved of by 
the faculty. He infuriates most of his 
mentors—and some of the students—
by refusing to make anything of himself, 
despite clearly understanding the lessons 
better than many of his peers.
Chizire is known for his daring antics, 
such as infiltrating the kitchen or stealing 
magic items from campus, but his 
ultimate goal for the year is to enchant 
one of Nantambu’s 10 pillar landmarks 
to tell bawdy jokes. Getting past all the 
magical wards on the pillars would be 
an incredible challenge, but Chizire thinks 
he can manage it with a bit of help, provided no one 
snitches on him to the teachers.
ESI DJANA
LG | female | human | ace student
Branch: Tempest-Sun Mages
Classroom Advantage: Treat your successes to Study for 
Tempest-Sun Mage classes as critical successes instead.
Specialty Spell: impeccable flow (page 76)
Notable Skills:  Arcana, Athletics, Diplomacy, 
Society
Hobbies: university administration, campus 
exploration, book printing, book binding, 
sports, tactical wargames, fashion contests
Most Well Known For: once spent 15 straight 
minutes reciting different synonyms for 
“wrong” to make a point in an argument
Strangest Quirk:  leaving baubles at magically 
derived coordinates for others to find
Common Associates: Anchor Root (working 
on musical playback magic), Haibram 
and Mariama (sparring partners), 
Okoro (exercise partner), Tzeniwe 
(babysitting)
Every school has its star students, 
and anyone who knows Esi Djana 
knows that she’s one of them. A 
Nantambu native, Esi engages the academy 
with an energy few can match. On any given day, Esi 
can be found organizing students for study groups and 
extracurricular activities, commanding the field for 
several of Nantambu’s sports teams, independently 
researching foreign policy and military defense 
tactics, and still finding time for an active 
social life and dates with similarly ambitious 
young men. Esi is also known for around 
campus being kind, passionate, and 
genuine, going out of her way to 
approach shier or more anxious 
students who seem to have trouble 
making friends. Determined to follow 
in the footsteps of her Tempest-Sun 
Mage mother, whom she idolizes, Esi is 
a student who is clearly going places—a 
fact that attracts admirers, 
detractors, and opportunists in 
equal measure. 
Esi’s obstacles stem from 
her strengths. The young woman is 
not shy about challenging her teachers, 
or the academy administration itself, when 
she feels something can be done better. While some 
teachers encourage her spirited initiative (Takulu 
Ot perhaps most of all), others can be dismissive or 
outright hostile.

HAIBRAM THODJA
CG | male | dwarf | daredevil
Branch: Rain-Scribes
Classroom Advantage: When you Cram for Rain-Scribe 
classes, you can Study three times rather than twice.
Specialty Spell: airburst (page 76)
Notable Skills: Arcana, Athletics, Intimidation, 
Survival
Hobbies: recreational combat, cloud-
watching, hang-gliding, pyromania
Most Well Known For: jumping off a 
three-story building to win a game 
of tag
Strangest Quirk:  constantly found 
at the scene of fires that are actually 
never his fault
Common Associates: Chizire (drinking 
partner), Esi and Mariama (sparring partners)
Haibram’s philosophy in life 
could be summed up as “go 
hard or go home.” Though on 
the whole a friendly person, the 
Mbe’ke dwarf approaches anything 
resembling a competition with perhaps a little too 
much enthusiasm. While most of his idiosyncrasies 
are harmless, such as entering footraces in full battle 
armor, others demonstrate a rash impulsiveness, such 
as the time he leapt out brandishing an axe during 
an Uzunjati scary story competition. For 
those who aren’t put off by his wild 
antics, Haibram can be the highlight 
of any party. Whether it’s rock-
climbing, rooftop races at midnight, 
or igniting colorful explosives, his 
exploits almost always make for 
interesting stories. 
Though Haibram’s natural 
magical mastery is focused on the 
element of air, his true enthusiasm is 
fire. It’s an open secret Haibram wants to 
join the Tempest-Sun Mages and rain 
destruction down on his foes, but the 
branch’s obligation to defend (and 
thus remain near) the Magaambya 
has left him unwilling to commit. 
For now, he satisfies himself 
with learning how to survive and 
thrive in any circumstances by studying 
under the Rain-Scribes. He skillfully combines 
physical combat with magic, using wind to dart 
across the battlefield or add hurricane force to thrown 
mambeles and swung clubs.
IGNACI CANTERELLS
N | male | human | thaumaturge
Branch: Emerald Boughs
Classroom Advantage: When you Cram for Emerald Boughs 
classes, treat your critical failures as failures instead.
Specialty Formula: forgetful ink (page 75)
Notable Skills: Crafting, Society, Stealth, Thievery
Hobbies: cryptography, high fashion, covert 
explorations
Most Well Known For: being easily swayed 
into bad decisions by attractive men
Strangest Quirk: starting his assignments 
over from the beginning every time he 
makes a mistake
Common Associates:  Chizire (brewing 
experimental elixirs), Noxolo and Tzeniwe 
(sewing clothing), Okoro 
(cleaning house in card 
games, being talked into bad 
decisions)
Born in the colony of Sargava before 
it became the nation of Vidrian, Ignaci 
earned his parents’ disapproval through 
the company he kept—rebellious youths, disaffected 
soldiers, and the native Mwangi populace. This minor 
rebellion proved enough for Ignaci’s colonist family 
to abandon him at the start of the Vidric Revolution, 
deliberately stranding the teenager amid the violent 
chaos. Ignaci joined the fight for Vidrian’s 
freedom, in part for justice but mainly driven 
by a hatred of his family and everyone like 
them. Ignaci hopes to one day aid Vidrian 
against foreign interests.
The trauma of these experiences 
taught Ignaci three lessons: shut up, 
keep your head down, and trust no one. 
Though his work ethic, politeness, and 
intelligence all impress his teachers, he 
avoids attention and has no close friends. 
He also remains incredibly paranoid, 
writing all of his study notes in a 
secret code. 
Ignaci spends most of his 
free time stealthily exploring 
the school’s nooks and 
crannies, leaving coded notes to 
himself in an ink that is visible only 
when exposed to a special alchemical 
light. Unknown to him, other students have 
discovered these notes, mistaken them for something 
more significant, and formed a small group called the 
Cryptic Circle that is dedicated to solving them.

MARIAMA KEITANA
CN | female | human | chaos magnet
Branch: Cascade Bearers
Classroom Advantage: You can reroll 
a check to Study for a 
Cascade Bearer class; this 
is a fortune effect.
Specialty Magic: Lesson of 
Calamity (page 75)
Notable Skills:  Deception, 
Intimidation, Occultism, 
Religion
Hobbies: combat theory, 
occult lore, linguistics 
Most Well Known For: summoning 
a devil on accident during a 
complex mathematical proof
Strangest Quirk: knows swear words in 
almost every language on Golarion
Common Associates:  Chizire (brewing 
weird liquors), Okoro (board games), Esi 
and Haibram (sparring partners)
Teachers at the Magaambya tactfully 
describe Mariama as a student with an “interesting” 
personality. Undeniably a knowledgeable occultist 
and accomplished spellcaster, the young woman 
falters between responsibility and unreliability with 
infuriating frequency. Her attitude likewise flips 
between unbearable kindness to her friends 
and outright viciousness to her foes.
Mariama lives the kind of life that 
even storytellers might consider 
unrealistic, with wildly fluctuating 
luck and outlandish events frequently 
plaguing her. She likes to tell stories 
that are even more unbelievable, 
leaving her fellows to wonder whether 
Mariama is cursed, blessed, or just a 
pathological liar. To date, Mariama has 
nearly started a cult by accident while drunk, 
been subjected to school discipline for 
selling curses, and had her heirloom 
magical staff disintegrated by a freak 
bolt of lightning. 
Mariama can rapidly piece together 
disparate clues, but her focus on the 
occult and the exceptional often leads her 
astray. She’s quick to proclaim supernatural 
influence where there is none, such as accusing 
fey for crop failures when quelea birds are to blame. 
Yet when uncanny forces truly are at work, Mariama’s 
insights are frighteningly accurate.
NOXOLO
LN | female | human | augur
Branch: Uzunjati
Classroom Advantage: Treat your critical failures to Study 
in Uzunjati classes as failures instead.
Specialty Spell: grave impressions (page 77)
Notable Skills:  Deception, Medicine, 
Performance, Religion
Hobbies: dance, high fashion, kite-flying, 
watching motes of dust float through the air
Most Well Known For:  pausing to dance and 
sing about what she’s doing when excited
Strangest Quirk:  always uses murder in her 
hypothetical examples
Common Associates: Anchor Root (scavenging 
bones), Ignaci and Tzeniwe (discussing 
fashion)
Noxolo fled from her home to 
escape her overbearing family, 
who had planned out every aspect of 
her life. Whispers from dead birds and 
cow bones told her she could find freedom 
at the Magaambya, and so she went, not 
knowing what to expect. What she discovered was 
a far bigger world than she’d ever dreamt possible, 
and a chance to unravel the mysteries of the strange 
whispers she hears. Though highly prone to spacing 
out during lectures, Noxolo does her best not to take 
her acceptance at the Magaambya for granted. 
The transition has been rougher on her than 
she likes to admit, however, and she often 
finds herself wracked with homesickness 
and guilt for leaving the family who 
cared enough about her to plan her life in 
such detail.
Noxolo dressed as a man to avoid being 
tracked down while traveling, noticing that 
many overlooked someone who appeared 
to be a man if they were searching for a 
woman. By the time she reached the 
Magaambya, Noxolo found she 
preferred her new look and 
has begun to experiment with 
various fashions and hairstyles.
Noxolo is accompanied at all 
times by a bizarre, 2-foot-long pet she 
refers to as her “snabble,” a creature that 
resembles a fuzzy cross between a crocodile and a 
bear cub. The creature has attracted more than its 
fair share of curious scholars, though Noxolo herself 
seems uninterested in what sort of creature it truly is 
or where it originally came from.

OKORO OBIYO
NG | male | human | researcher
Branch: Uzunjati
Classroom Advantage: You don’t get tired after 
you Cram for Uzunjati classes.
Specialty Spell: mind games (page 77)
Notable Skills:  Athletics, Diplomacy, 
Performance, Occultism
Hobbies: sports, board games, 
card games, deep research dives into 
random topics
Most Well Known For: preparing an 
8-hour presentation on a completely 
different topic than the teacher 
assigned
Strangest Quirk: is scared of butterflies
Common Associates:  Chizire and 
Mariama (gaming group), Esi 
(exercise partner), Ignaci (talking 
him into bad decisions)
A bright-eyed and excitable Bonuwat 
youth from Senghor, Okoro’s love of eclectic research 
got him shipped off to the Magaambya to hone his 
talents and, some joke, to spare everyone else in 
Senghor from his enthusiasm. To Okoro, whatever 
has caught his interest for the month is the most 
exciting thing ever, and nothing can pry 
his attention and passion away from 
it. The self-directed nature of the 
Magaambya’s classes has allowed 
him to pursue these interests more 
often than a typical university, 
and Okoro is considered one of 
the top students at his rank. His 
relentless positivity in the face 
of challenges, setbacks, and the 
occasional near-death experience 
have likewise gained him many 
friends. Though his confidence 
and gusto can occasionally lead him 
to being shortsighted and even 
self-centered, most find him to be a 
bright spot in a complicated world.
Okoro is a natural athlete 
who excelled at aquatic sports 
in Senghor and now enjoys footraces and 
kickball in Nantambu. He also possesses 
a truly staggering collection of board games and 
card decks, and periodically drags fellow students 
into playing them. His most successful endeavor is 
his biweekly game night, often compete for favors, 
magical formulas, or campus secrets.
STRANDS-OF-GLOWING-DAWN TZENIWE
NG | female | anadi | dreamweaver
Branch: Emerald Boughs
Classroom Advantage: Treat your successes to Study 
for Emerald Boughs classes as critical successes 
instead, but this doesn’t apply when you Cram.
Specialty Spell: friendfetch (page 77)
Notable Skills:  Crafting, Diplomacy, 
Performance, Society
Hobbies: bird-watching, baking, high fashion
Most Well Known For:  having elaborate 
themed outfits for every class
Strangest Quirk:  leaving hidden anonymous 
gifts for people 
Common Associates:  Anchor Root (stress 
baking), Esi (babysitting), Ignaci and 
Noxolo (weaving cloth and sewing 
clothing)
A middle-aged woman who 
stands out among her younger peers, 
Tzeniwe sought the Magaambya later in 
life to gain an advanced education in the hopes of 
passing that education down to her children. A shy 
and awkward person from the nation of Nurvatcha, 
Tzeniwe knows that many in the Mwangi Expanse 
mistakenly believe shapeshifting anadis to be 
humans who turn into hideous spider creatures 
at night. Though the Magaambya possess’s 
a much more enlightened view on anadis, 
Tzeniwe is still painfully aware that 
many humanoids are terrified of spiders. 
Indeed, she’s more forgiving of repulsed 
reactions than her friends think she should 
be. Possessing a cooperative and generous 
nature, Tzeniwe often leaves her peers 
small gifts to make them comfortable, such 
as cups of chilled tea, delicious snacks, or 
even soft scarves and kaftans. 
Despite her introversion, Tzeniwe’s 
two toddlers constantly pull her out 
of her shell. Named Zachva and 
Zanvi, the rambunctious pair have 
no qualms about jumping around 
in spider form, pestering other 
students, or climbing into places 
they shouldn’t. Academy students have become 
impressed with Tzeniwe’s ability to lasso her children 
from over 50 paces to retrieve them. Though Tzeniwe 
usually carries them with her during classes, a large 
spiderling on her back and a human child on one knee, 
she often asks others to watch them when the twins 
refuse to behave.
