Content Warning
While Pathfinder Adventure Path #169: Kindled Magic  contains typical Pathfinder action and adventure, it also presents, in Chapter 3, 
a few stark depictions of animal cruelty and abuse. Before you begin, understand that consent from everyone at the table, including 
the players and the Game Master, is vital to a safe and fun play experience. You should talk with your players before beginning the 
adventure and modify descriptions or scenarios as appropriate.
