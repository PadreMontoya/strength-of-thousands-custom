“Listen, for this is a story that means something. I sing the 
songs of those who came before. They taught us much 
that we remember today, and even more that we have 
forgotten. I sing the song of the one, the Old Mage, who 
showed us the way. I sing the songs of the Ten, the Magic 
Warriors who spread his mission. I sing the songs of the 
hundreds who built this school and shone a light over all 
the world. And I sing the songs of the thousands, all those 
who came before us and made this place the Magaambya. 
Their strength and their legacies live on in me. Now they 
shall live on in you as well.” —Lore-Speaker Janatimo
In the Strength of Thousands Adventure Path, you’ll 
have the opportunity to play characters who are 
students at the Magaambya, the oldest and most 
storied magic school in all Golarion. You’ll learn new 
magic, advance in your studies, choose one of the five 
prestigious branches to join, and more. As you continue 
your academic career, adventure will call, but you’ll 
never cease to be a Magaambyan, tied inextricably to 
the thousands upon thousands of students who came 
before you, stretching across eight millennia of history 
and tracing back to the legacy of Old-Mage Jatembe, 
one of the most legendary and powerful wizards in the 
history of Golarion. 
The academia subsystem helps you express 
your character’s academic and intellectual growth 
throughout your time at the Magaambya, starting 
as a new initiate struggling to find your place at the 
school to an academic powerhouse respected by all 
researchers in your field and beyond. You’ll continue 
your studies alongside your adventuring career, 
allowing you to gain a series of useful benefits to 
improve your character’s capabilities based on the 
progress of your academic work. 
The Five Branches of Scholarship
“As the creeping menace swept across the land, the snake 
led the way, ever the adaptable guide, ready to shed skin 
to fit the situation. The patient leopard, full of valor, crept 
closer toward the oncoming threat, the better to protect 
her friends from danger. The spider whispered quietly. 
Would the people be safe? Our comrades, our friends, 
our families? Would this be the end? The hyena laughed—
not even he, who looks between, could have imagined 
the scope of the threat. But it was not the end, and the 
elephant never forgot.” —Elephant’s Chronicles
Magaambyan scholars believe in many fundamental 
values of scholarship. Key among them are adaptability, 
camaraderie, imagination, knowledge, and valor. 
The school’s faculty and lessons are divided into five 
branches, each emphasizing one of these values. 
Cascade Bearers  esteem imagination, from the 
dreams of the most visionary magical theorists to the 
innovations of creative problem-solvers of all stripes. 
Emerald Boughs emphasize camaraderie, the sense 
of community and connection to fellow Magaambyans; 
they also interact with those outside the Magaambya 
and spread the academy’s message. 
Rain-Scribes value adaptability in thoughts and 
deeds, as well as a willingness to admit errors and 
learn from past mistakes.
Tempest-Sun Mages  inspire valor, not only the 
physical courage to stand up for friends and the 
school, but also the intellectual courage to consider 
opposing viewpoints and widen one’s understanding 
rather than staying entrenched in a single paradigm. 
Uzunjati understand that knowledge lives in stories 
passed down through the generations and also is 
earned every day through personal experience. 
While all Magaambyans are expected to embody 
these values to varying degrees, and members of the 
different branches work together on and off campus, 
every student joins one primary branch to shape 
their academic understanding. In addition to this 
choice, you’ll also select a secondary branch that 
influences the expression of your primary branch and 
supplements your education. Your learning within

these branches progresses from levels 1 to 20, just like 
your character. You can never have more levels in your 
primary branch than your character’s level, and you 
can never have more levels in your secondary branch 
than half your character’s level. When you create your 
character, choose a primary branch and a secondary 
branch; both begin at level 0.
Classes at the Magaambya are open to students of 
any branch, but each focuses on the values embodied by 
a specific branch. If your primary branch is Tempest-Sun 
Mages and your secondary branch is Rain-Scribes, 
you’ll attend Tempest-Sun Mage classes to advance your 
level in your primary branch or Rain-Scribe classes to 
advance your level in your secondary branch. You don’t 
need to create a specific course load or class schedule, 
since you’re always choosing whether to focus on your 
primary or secondary branch. 
BRANCH SKILLS, LORES, AND FEATS
Each branch has two or three associated skills, one 
or more subcategories of lore, and a general feat. As 
you gain levels in your branch, you’ll gain benefits that 
apply to the associated skills and lore, as well as the 
associated general feat.
CHANGING BRANCHES
It’s perfectly natural that a player might choose a 
primary or secondary branch at character creation 
and, after roleplaying the character for some time, 
decide it was the wrong branch to represent their 
character’s personality. While your GM could create 
a downtime activity to allow branch retraining in 
place of advancing in a branch, this can wind up 
permanently leaving your character behind the rest of 
your party. Instead, work with your GM to swap out 
your branches. Keep in mind, the Magaambya looks 
extremely poorly on those who flippantly attempt to 
alter their branches of scholarship to gain personal 
power and will staunchly deny any such exploit.
Advancing Your Branch Level
“From my time studying medicine at the Magaambya, I 
might not have learned any magic, but I did learn to value 
service over promoting my academic publications. That’s 
not to say the Magaambya doesn’t produce some of the 
finest scholarship in the world, but rather that a true 
Magaambyan doesn’t care about taking credit. It’s about 
building knowledge for everyone. Of course, that sort of 
attitude led to my work being plagiarized before I started 
taking authorship more seriously, so this ideal isn’t as 
an absolute. Still, it’s the heroic attitude of Magaambyan 
scholars that has changed the world for millennia and 
continues to change it to this day.” —Kassi Aziril
Unlike your character’s level, your levels in your 
primary and secondary branches don’t advance 
automatically when you gain Experience Points. 
Instead, you advance your branches through academic 
achievement; early in your career, this typically 
happens via bookwork and exams. As a student at the 
Magaambya, you can use either the Study downtime 
activity or the Cram downtime activity to represent 
your accomplishments in your studies and exams, with 
the timing based on the academic calendar (as noted 
for the GM in each volume of the Adventure Path). 
Truly accomplished scholars also might be able 
to use the Practical Research activity as a downtime 
activity in the field to gain additional new insights and 
academic advancements during adventures, as opposed 
to during the normal curriculum. Later volumes of the 
Adventure Path will note such opportunities for the 
GM, but if you have additional ideas for location-based 
research beyond those provided in the adventures 
GMS, SHARE THIS WITH YOUR PLAYERS
The details of the academia subsystem aren’t a 
secret. This article is spoiler-free and written from a 
player’s perspective, so you can share it with your 
players and help them make informed decisions for 
their characters’ academic careers. Throughout the 
Adventure Path, you’ll find numerous opportunities 
to tie into the academia subsystem, called out either 
in sidebars or in the text.

themselves, the GM might reward your creativity with 
an additional opportunity to perform the Practical 
Research activity and raise your branch levels! 
Even with these extra opportunities, you can’t 
advance your primary branch level above your 
character’s level, or your secondary branch level 
above half your character’s level (both with a 
minimum of 0). If the result of any of these activities 
would raise a branch level past those limits, put a 
star next to your branch’s level. The next time your 
character gains a level, raise that branch’s level to the 
new limit and erase the star. This way, if you have an 
opportunity to advance your branch level, you don’t 
have to wait until your character level is high enough 
to pursue it.
Each of these downtime activities takes a few 
months, as they occur over an academic semester. You 
might have encounters during or between these checks 
as the story requires.
STUDY
DOWNTIME
Requirements You are an initiate, attendant, or conversant.
You give everything you have to your studies, in keeping 
with your branch. Choose either your primary or 
secondary branch and attempt a skill check with one of 
the branch’s associated skills against a standard DC of the 
branch’s level. 
Critical Success Incredible results! You ace every exam 
and cause a stir that all the instructors notice. Increase 
the level of the branch you chose by 2.
Success You succeed in your studies admirably. Increase 
the level of the branch you chose by 1.
Failure You need to work harder and try again. Your 
branch level remains the same.
Critical Failure You make a major mistake that requires 
you to perform remedial studies. The next time you 
would get an opportunity to attempt this activity, you 
must skip that opportunity to catch up.
CRAM
DOWNTIME
Requirements You are an initiate, attendant, or conversant, 
and your branch level for either your primary or 
secondary branch is 2 or more levels below the limit. 
Realizing that you’re falling behind in your studies, you 
cram more than you probably should. You Study twice, 
each in a branch that satisfies the activity requirements. 
However, the extra studying comes at a price. Until the 
next time you take the Study downtime activity, you’re 
particularly tired from all the extra hours cramming; at 
the start of each day of adventuring, you must succeed at 
a DC 8 flat check or be fatigued for that day.
PRACTICAL RESEARCH
DOWNTIME
Requirement You are a conversant or lore-speaker.
You identify something interesting in the field and perform 
special research on it. This requires an appropriate check, 
which the GM will describe when the opportunity arises. 
The results of the check vary. While they typically include 
all the benefits of the Study activity, some opportunities 
for Practical Research also offer unique benefits, such as 
access to new character options.

Branch Benefits
“Many of you already understand that the five branches of 
scholarship shape your journey through the Magaambya. 
What you probably haven’t realized is that they will shape 
your legacy as well. All of us stand here buoyed by the 
strength of the thousands who came before, each with 
their own unique story to tell. Ask yourself: what will your 
story be?” —High Sun-Mage Oyamba
At every branch level, you gain the benefit listed in 
Table 2 above. The benefit entries below also include 
the branch levels at which you gain them.
ADDITIONAL LORE  1ST
At 1st level in a branch, you learn more of the 
Magaambya’s deep well of lore associated with your 
branch. You gain the Additional Lore feat in a Lore 
skill associated with the branch.

STEEPED IN HISTORY  2ND
At 2nd level in a branch, you learn about the history of 
the branch and the Magaambya in general. You gain a 
+1 circumstance bonus to Recall Knowledge about the 
Magaambya, the tenets or history of your branch, and 
members of your branch. 
At 11th level, this increases to a +2 circumstance 
bonus.
DEDICATED ATTENDANT  3RD
At 3rd level in a branch, if you have 
completed your Perquisite, you 
have proven your commitment 
to a sufficient degree that your 
branch promotes and supports 
you as an affiliated attendant. The 
first time you reach this level in a 
branch, you gain the Magaambyan 
Attendant Dedication feat ( Pathfinder 
Lost Omens Character Guide  101) as 
a bonus feat (even if you haven’t taken 
enough feats with a previous archetype to 
take another dedication feat). 
SKILL FEAT  4TH
At 4th level in a branch, you uncover hidden techniques 
that grant you extra benefits from your branch’s 
associated skills. You gain a skill feat that requires the 
trained rank in one the branch’s associated skills. 
At 9th level, you gain an additional skill feat that 
requires the expert or trained rank in one the branch’s 
associated skills; at 15th level, you gain an additional 
skill feat that requires master or lower rank in one of 
the branch’s associated skills; and at 19th level, you 
gain an additional skill feat that requires legendary or 
lower rank in one of the branch’s associated skills. For 
any of these skill feats, you can select a variable skill 
feat, such as Automatic Knowledge or Assurance, as 
long as you do so for an associated skill.
BRANCH INFLUENCE  5TH
At 5th level in a branch, you gain greater influence, 
making it easier to collaborate, hoodwink, or 
browbeat members of that branch. You gain a +1 
circumstance bonus on Deception, Diplomacy, 
Intimidation, and Performance checks to interact with 
members of the branch. 
At 13th level, this increases to a +2 circumstance 
bonus, and at 17th level, it increases again to a +3 
circumstance bonus.
SKILL INCREASE  6TH
At 6th level in a branch, and every 4 levels thereafter, 
your studies lead you to deeper understanding of 
your branch’s associated skills, causing you to gain an 
additional skill increase that you can use to raise one 
of the branch’s associated skills, up to a maximum 
of expert. 
At 10th branch level or higher, you can use these 
skill increases to become a master in a skill in which 
you’re already an expert. At 18th level, you can use 
this skill increase to become legendary in a skill in 
which you’re already a master. For Uzunjati, who 
have Lore as an associated skill, you gain the 
Additional Lore feat when you choose to 
improve Lore, instead of gaining a single 
skill increase to a Lore.
BRANCH FEAT  7TH
At 7th level in a branch, you 
become so immersed in your 
branch’s secrets that you gain 
access to special training only 
offered to other members 
of your branch. You gain the 
6th-level Magaambyan attendant 
archetype feat requiring affiliation with 
your branch (such as Uzunjati Storytelling for the 
Uzunjati). You must still meet any skill prerequisites 
the feat has. If you already have that feat, you gain an 
additional 6th-level class feat (even if your branch’s 
feat was not a class feat). 
At 12th level, you also gain the 10th-level 
Magaambyan attendant archetype feat requiring 
affiliation with the branch (such as Tempest-Sun 
Shielding for the Tempest-Sun Mages). If you already 
have that feat, you gain an additional 10th-level class 
feat (even if your branch’s feat was not a class feat).
GENERAL FEAT  8TH
At 8th level in a branch, your understanding of your 
branch’s traditions improves your general capabilities, 
stretching beyond your studies in specific skills. You 
ACADEMIA? NO THANKS 
While many players in an Adventure Path about a 
magic academy might be interested in developing 
their characters’ academic careers, some might want 
to skip right to the action. That’s okay! You can either 
skip the subsystem entirely, in which case characters 
will be a little less versatile than normal, or just allow 
characters to automatically advance their primary 
branch at every even level, to a maximum branch 
level of 11 when the character reaches level 20.

gain the general feat associated with the branch. If 
you already have that general feat, you gain a 1st-level 
general feat of your choice instead.
MAKE YOUR OWN LUCK  16TH
At 16th level in a branch, you’re so accomplished with 
your branch’s associated skills that you make your 
own luck. Once per day, you can reroll a skill check 
with one of those skills and take the new result. This 
is a fortune effect.
MAGICAL PARAGON  20TH
At 20th level in a branch, you embody the branch 
so completely that you gain a unique special ability 
depending on your branch. Many of these abilities 
build upon Magaambyan attendant archetype feats 
you have gained.
Cascade Bearers : Nothing is beyond your 
imagination. Once per day, you can cast any common 
7th-level spell from the arcane, divine, occult, or 
primal spell lists without expending a spell slot. When 
you do, you use your spellcasting proficiency for your 
halcyon spells.
Emerald Boughs : You can stretch your hideaway 
well beyond the original intended usage, creating a 
special extradimensional abode in which to rest with 
your allies, host visiting diplomats, and more. At any 
time, you can spend 1 minute to enter and expand 
your hideaway into a magnificent mansion; it remains 
in this form until you leave, at which point it expels all 
remaining guests and becomes a normal hideaway as 
Emerald Boughs Hideaway until you spend another 
minute to enter and expand your hideaway again.
Rain-Scribes: You can adapt to almost any 
situation. You can survive in severe and extreme 
cold and heat without taking damage. You move at 
full Speed through difficult terrain and greater 
difficult terrain, and take no damage 
from hazardous terrain. When using 
Rain-Scribe Mobility, you clear the 
effects of all three types of terrain from the 
spaces you enter for 1 round.
Tempest-Sun Mages: You have the courage and 
magic to protect all your allies from harm. When 
you use Tempest-Sun Shielding, you can choose 
to reduce the triggering damage to you and all 
allies within 30 feet by four times the spell level, 
rather than reducing the triggering damage to 
you or a single ally by four times the spell level.
Uzunjati: You know a surprising number of 
stories, and you weave them all together into 
a coherent narrative. When you use Uzunjati 
Recollection, you Recall Knowledge three times 
instead of once, each with a +2 circumstance bonus. 
You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your skill 
check for Uzunjati Storytelling from the captivating 
combined narrative.
ROLEPLAYING ACADEMIA
The academia subsystem is at its best when the 
players and GM use the opportunity as a backdrop 
for roleplaying events and occurrences that highlight 
the reality of life at a magic academy, rather than 
just quickly rolling some skill checks and tallying up 
branch levels. Maybe one hero has to go on a hunt 
for a book that should be available in the library 
but has been lent out multiple times, while another 
must convince a straitlaced professor to allow them 
to conduct a potentially dangerous experiment. For 
more guidance on ideas for downtime events and 
how to intersperse them throughout downtime, refer 
to pages 22 and 25 of the Gamemastery Guide.
