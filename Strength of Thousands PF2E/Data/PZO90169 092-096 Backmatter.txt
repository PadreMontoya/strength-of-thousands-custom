SPOKEN ON THE SONG WIND
by Quinn Murphy
The heroes have proven themselves to be worthy 
additions to Magaambya school of magic. Trusted to 
handle important school business in the surrounding 
city of Nantambu, the Song-Wind City, they pursue 
seemingly simple investigations that hint at much 
deeper troubles. From a ruthless crime boss grasping 
for more power to inhuman infiltrators poised to strike 
at Nantambu’s government, the heroes must untangle 
webs of treachery and danger!
