## Conversation Topics

### **Introduction & Sales Pitch**
• *"Welcome to our humble abode! I'm Ignaci Canterells, entrepreneur, scholar, and purveyor of fine alchemical solutions. *flashes practiced smile* That smile took me three weeks to perfect in the mirror, by the way. Worth every minute."*
• *"Now, I don't want to be presumptuous, but you'll inevitably need supplies, and the campus store charges absolutely criminal prices. I offer a more... personalized service. Think of me as your friendly neighborhood alchemist with competitive rates and flexible payment plans!"*
• *"I once sold a love potion to someone I had a crush on. Took me twenty minutes to realize what I'd done. Fortunately, he thought it was hilarious and asked me out anyway. Sometimes my business instincts override my common sense in the most embarrassing ways."*
• *"Quality is my reputation, and my reputation is everything. Well, almost everything. My reputation and my devastatingly good looks. And my charming personality. Alright, fine, I have many valuable assets."*

### **Emerald Boughs & Academic Focus**
• *"Tzeniwe and I are working toward joining the Emerald Boughs. We study the world as it is—communities, people, current events."*
• *"It's fascinating how much you can learn about a society by studying its present-day customs and interactions."*
• *"The Emerald Boughs teach us to understand people and cultures. That knowledge is incredibly valuable."*
• *"I find that understanding how people think and what they want makes everything else easier."*

### **Dormitory Welcome & Room Advice**
• *"Welcome to Spire Dormitory! I'm Ignaci Canterells, and it's a pleasure to meet you all."*
• *"You'll find the accommodations quite comfortable. Each room has the basics—bed, couch, chest—and beautiful mosaic floors throughout."*
• *"Some rooms are larger than others, which can be a bit of a sore point among residents. The building was converted from other purposes, so there's some variation."*
• *"I'd recommend installing a lock if you value privacy. It's a small expense, but worth it for peace of mind."*
• *"The common room is the heart of our social life here. Beautiful mosaics, comfortable couches, and perfect for our weekly gatherings."*
• *"If you're interested in a room with good light for crafting or reading, I can point out which ones get the best natural illumination."*
• *"The Soaring Spire is quite the novelty—you can jump incredibly high near it. Haibram's always using it for his aerial adventures."*

### **Social Life & Game Night**
• *"We hold a weekly game night here at the dormitory. You should join us—it's a great way to unwind and get to know everyone."*
• *"I'm quite good at card games, though I'll admit strategy games aren't my strongest suit."*
• *"Social connections are just as important as academic ones. You never know when a friendship might prove valuable."*
• *"The other students here are fascinating. Everyone has their own unique talents and perspectives."*

### **Crafting & Alchemy**
• *"I've been working on some experimental elixirs with Chizire. His brewing techniques are... unconventional, but effective."*
• *"My specialty formula is forgetful ink—quite useful for certain situations, if you know what I mean."*
• *"Alchemy is as much art as science. You have to understand not just the formulas, but the principles behind them."*
• *"I take pride in my work. When someone buys from me, they know they're getting quality."*

### **Fashion & Appearance**
• *"I believe in presenting yourself well. First impressions matter more than people like to admit."*
• *"Tzeniwe and I work with Noxolo on clothing projects. She's incredibly talented with textiles."*
• *"There's something to be said for looking the part. Confidence starts with how you present yourself."*
• *"I enjoy keeping up with the latest fashions. It's another way to understand contemporary culture."*

### **Relationships & Attraction**
• *"My weakness for handsome men is legendary around here. Last month I agreed to help someone with their 'research project' that turned out to be sneaking into the restricted library section. All because he had these incredible eyes and asked so nicely. We got caught, obviously."*
• *"Okoro could convince me to jump off the Soaring Spire if he smiled the right way. He has this innocent 'trust me' expression that completely bypasses my common sense. It's infuriating and endearing and I fall for it every single time."*
• *"I once spent an entire afternoon following someone around campus because they had the most beautiful laugh. Didn't even know their name! Tzeniwe had to stage an intervention and remind me that stalking isn't romantic, it's creepy."*
• *"My heart is like an overenthusiastic puppy—it sees something pretty and immediately wants to chase it, regardless of consequences. My brain spends a lot of time apologizing for my heart's poor decision-making."*

### **Academic Habits & Perfectionism**
• *"I once rewrote the same essay seventeen times because I kept finding tiny flaws. Seventeen! Esi finally had to physically remove the quill from my hand and submit it for me. It got top marks, which was both vindicating and infuriating."*
• *"My perfectionism drives my roommates crazy. I'll spend three hours arranging my supplies in perfect order, then Chizire walks by and everything gets covered in mysterious purple residue. It's like the universe is testing my patience."*
• *"Last week I started an alchemy experiment over six times because my measurements were off by tiny amounts. Chizire watched me do it and said 'You know, sometimes 'close enough' is actually close enough.' Blasphemy! There's no such thing as 'close enough' in precision work!"*
• *"I know I'm obsessive, but when you're working with volatile substances, 'good enough' can mean the difference between a successful potion and explaining to the healers why your eyebrows are missing. Again."*

### **Background & Origins**
• *"I was born in Sargava before it became Vidrian. It's interesting to see how political changes affect daily life."*
• *"Growing up during that transition taught me a lot about adaptation and reading social situations."*
• *"Change can be unsettling, but it also creates opportunities for those who know how to navigate it."*
• *"My background gives me a unique perspective on cultural shifts and social dynamics."*

### **Covert Activities & Secrets**
• *"I enjoy... exploring areas of the campus that aren't typically accessible to students. For research purposes, of course."*
• *"Sometimes the most interesting information isn't found in books or lectures."*
• *"I have a talent for getting into places I probably shouldn't be. It's useful for gathering materials and information."*
• *"Cryptography is a hobby of mine. There's something satisfying about hidden messages and secret codes."*

### **Business & Negotiation**
• *"I'm always willing to negotiate on prices, especially for regular customers or bulk orders."*
• *"Quality costs a bit more, but it's worth it when you need something to work properly."*
• *"I can usually find or make whatever you need, given enough time and the right materials."*
• *"Think of me as your personal alchemical consultant. I'm here to help fellow students succeed."*
