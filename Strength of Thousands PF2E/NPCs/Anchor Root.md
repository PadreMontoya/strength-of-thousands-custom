## Conversation Topics

### **Introduction & Social Anxiety**
• *"Oh! *drops chicken stick and scrambles to hide behind a chair* Sorry! I was just... the shadows were making these fascinating geometric patterns and I got distracted. I do that a lot. Stare at things, I mean. Not drop chickens. Well, sometimes I drop chickens too."*
• *"Last week someone screamed when they saw me eating beetles in the common room. I mean, they were perfectly seasoned! But apparently 'crunchy snacks' means different things to different people. I've started eating them in my room now... though I did leave some on Ignaci's pillow as a peace offering. He hasn't mentioned them yet."*
• *"You know what's funny? Everyone thinks I'm scary, but I'm actually terrified of butterflies. BUTTERFLIES! These tiny, delicate creatures that couldn't hurt a flower, and I see one and just... *makes panicked squeaking noise*. Okoro thinks it's hilarious."*
• *"The Magaambya is the first place where being weird isn't automatically bad. I mean, Chizire makes things explode for fun, and Mariama accidentally summoned a devil during math class. Compared to that, my beetle collection is practically normal!"*

### **Appearance & Self-Awareness**
• *"I've been practicing 'friendly expressions' in the mirror for weeks. Yesterday I thought I nailed it, but when I smiled at the baker, he dropped an entire tray of pastries and blessed himself. Twice. I'm starting to think my teeth are just... aggressively pointy."*
• *"Esi tried to help me with makeup once. She said we could 'soften my features.' Three hours later, I looked like a very confused raccoon who'd gotten into someone's paint supplies. We agreed to embrace my natural look after that."*
• *"You know what's weird? I scare people just by existing, but I'm the one who jumps at sudden noises, hides behind furniture, and once got so startled by my own reflection that I fell into a fountain. Who's really the scary one here?"*
• *"I tried wearing a hat to look more 'approachable' once. A big, floppy sun hat with flowers. Somehow it made me look like a carnivorous garden gnome. Fashion is not my strong suit."*

### **Ant Gnoll Heritage & Abilities**
• *"I can feel Haibram coming from three hallways away because he stomps like an excited elephant. Chizire tippy-toes like he's sneaking, but his brewing supplies clink. And Esi... Esi walks like she owns the world. It's actually quite inspiring."*
• *"My colony-sisters used to say I asked too many questions. 'Why do we follow the same paths?' 'What's beyond the hill?' 'Why can't we be friends with the surface dwellers?' They meant it as criticism, but look where curiosity got me! Though I do miss their group hugs."*
• *"Being tiny has perks! I once hid in a supply closet for six hours just to see what the professors talk about when students aren't around. Turns out they mostly complain about grading and argue about whose turn it is to buy coffee. Very disappointing, really."*
• *"These beetles are from my home colony—they're like... crunchy memories! *offers handful* They taste like sunshine and dirt and that feeling when you find the perfect hiding spot. No? Your loss! More nostalgic snacks for me."*

### **Academic Interests & Dark Magic**
• *"Professor Takulu is so sweet! When I asked about the theoretical applications of bone magic in healing, he didn't even flinch. Most people hear 'bone magic' and immediately think 'evil necromancer,' but he just said 'interesting question' and gave me three books to read!"*
• *"I don't understand why everyone gets squeamish about death magic. Death is just... the other side of life! Like how night follows day, or how my beetles molt their shells. It's natural! Beautiful, even, in its own way."*
• *"Last week I raised a small mouse skeleton just to see if I could make it dance. It was adorable! Like a tiny, bony ballet. But when Ignaci walked in, he screamed so loud that three other students came running. I felt terrible—the poor mouse skeleton got so startled it fell apart."*
• *"Being a bonekeeper means helping people understand death isn't the enemy—fear of death is. I want to help families say goodbye properly, help archaeologists understand ancient peoples, maybe even help solve mysteries! Though I should probably work on my 'reassuring presence' first."*

### **Rain-Scribes & Nature Studies**
• *"The Rain-Scribes understand that nature includes both beautiful and frightening things. I appreciate that perspective."*
• *"I love studying the parts of nature that others find repulsive—decay, insects, the cycle of death and rebirth."*
• *"My rhythm bone helps me connect with natural rhythms that others can't perceive."*
• *"Nature isn't always pretty, but it's always honest. I find that comforting."*

### **Social Observations & Loneliness**
• *"The other students whisper about me, but that's okay. Whispers carry interesting information if you know how to listen properly."*
• *"I notice things about people that they don't realize they're showing. It's lonely being so observant sometimes."*
• *"I wish I could join conversations naturally, but I always seem to say the wrong thing."*
• *"Most people avoid me, but a few have been kind. Those friendships mean everything to me."*

### **Hobbies & Creative Outlets**
• *"I make sand sculptures in my spare time. There's something soothing about creating temporary beauty."*
• *"My pet fruit beetles are wonderful companions. They don't judge me for being different."*
• *"I've been working on musical curation with Esi. She's one of the few who doesn't seem afraid of me."*
• *"Would you like to see my beetle collection? They're quite beautiful once you get used to them."*

### **Dormitory Life & Room Observations**
• *"Oh! You're the new students? I'm sorry, I was just... dealing with the ant situation. They've been getting into everything lately."*
• *"The dormitory is quite nice, really. Open and airy, lots of natural light. The mosaics are beautiful, though they can hide small insects if you're not careful."*
• *"Some rooms are bigger than others, which causes some... tension among residents. I got one of the smaller ones, but I don't mind. Less space for pests to hide."*
• *"My room has stacks of cleaned bones in the corners and tubs for my beetle collection. I know it sounds strange, but they're quite well-behaved pets."*
• *"The Soaring Spire is fascinating from a physics perspective. I sometimes use it to observe the campus from above—you can see so much more from that height."*
• *"If you're choosing a room, consider the light exposure and proximity to the washrooms. Also, some rooms are closer to the common areas, which can be noisy during game night."*
• *"I'd suggest avoiding rooms near mine if you're... uncomfortable with the occasional chicken dropping or beetle escape. I try to keep them contained, but accidents happen."*

### **Pest Control & Practical Skills**
• *"I use my chicken familiar to keep unwanted bugs out of my room. It's quite effective, if unconventional."*
• *"I'm actually quite good at dealing with pest problems. My background gives me unique insights."*
• *"The ant infestation in the dormitory is fascinating from a behavioral perspective, even as I work to clear it out."*
• *"People think my methods are strange, but they work. Sometimes unconventional approaches are the most effective."*

### **Friendship & Acceptance**
• *"Esi has been kind to me, even helping with music projects. It means more than she probably realizes."*
• *"I know I'm not easy to be around, but I'm grateful for anyone willing to give me a chance."*
• *"The Magaambya is the first place where being different isn't automatically seen as being wrong."*
• *"I may be creepy, but I'm loyal to those who show me kindness. You'll never have a more devoted friend."*

### **Academic Struggles & Determination**
• *"I'm sorry, I'm boring you, aren't I? I always seem to say too much about the wrong things."*
• *"I know my presentations can be... intense. I get excited about subjects others find disturbing."*
• *"Sometimes I interrupt myself because I can see people getting uncomfortable. It's a bad habit."*
• *"I'm working on being less overwhelming in social situations. It's harder than you might think."*

### **Encouragement & Understanding**
• *"Everyone has something that makes them different. Mine is just more visible than most."*
• *"Don't be afraid to embrace the parts of yourself that others might find strange. They're often your greatest strengths."*
• *"The world needs people who can see beauty in dark places and find value in what others discard."*
• *"Being an outsider gives you perspective that insiders can never have. That's valuable, even if it's lonely."*
