## Conversation Topics

### **Introduction & Business**
• *"Ojofiri chicks, eh? *eyes narrow appraisingly* You've got good taste, I'll give you that. These aren't your grandmother's backyard chickens—these are premium birds with bloodlines I've been perfecting for twenty-three years."*
• *"I'm Makena. Been breeding chickens since before you were a twinkle in your father's eye, and I'll be breeding them long after you've forgotten what real quality looks like. This bald head? *rubs scalp* Earned every inch of it dealing with customers who think they know better than experience."*
• *"Four gold each, and before you start whining about the price, let me tell you something—I once sold a breeding pair to a merchant prince for fifty gold. FIFTY. These chicks will grow into birds worth their weight in silver, if you're smart enough to raise them right."*
• *"See that hourglass? *points to imaginary timepiece* Every grain of sand that falls is money walking away to someone who appreciates value when they see it. I've got customers lined up around the block for these beauties."*

### **Ojofiri Chickens & Quality**
• *"Ojofiri chickens are special—white faces, dark blue feathers, lavender combs. These chicks will grow into beautiful birds."*
• *"You can tell quality breeding by the dark blue feathers with white underbellies. Don't let anyone sell you inferior stock."*
• *"These birds are hardy and productive. They'll serve you well if you treat them right."*
• *"I've been perfecting my breeding lines for years. You won't find better Ojofiri chickens anywhere in Nantambu."*

### **Negotiation & Pricing**
• *"Four gold per chick is my price. You can try to negotiate, but I know what my birds are worth."*
• *"I might consider a lower price if you can make a compelling argument, but I'm not running a charity."*
• *"Time is money. Every minute you spend haggling is another chick sold to someone else."*
• *"I've heard every negotiation tactic in the book. Impress me if you want a better deal."*

### **Kafesi Market & Competition**
• *"The Kafesi Market moves around the city. We go where the business is best."*
• *"Some of the other vendors here will try to cheat you. I'm honest about my prices and my quality."*
• *"This market has a reputation for shrewd bargaining. If you can't handle that, maybe you should shop elsewhere."*
• *"I've been working these markets for decades. I know how to spot a serious buyer from a time-waster."*

### **Livestock Expertise & Advice**
• *"Chicks need to be kept warm, especially on cold, wet days like this. Don't let them get chilled or they'll die."*
• *"You'll need proper housing, good feed, and protection from predators. Chickens aren't as easy as people think."*
• *"If you're planning to breed them, make sure you get at least one male. Four chicks gives you decent odds."*
• *"These birds will lay well if you treat them right, but they're not forgiving of poor care."*

### **Customer Assessment & Skepticism**
• *"Magaambya students, right? *snorts* Let me guess—some professor told you to 'experience real commerce' or 'understand agricultural economics.' I've seen your type before. You'll buy my birds, name them after your favorite books, and then come crying to me when they die because you fed them nothing but cake crumbs and good intentions."*
• *"Please tell me you're not planning some ridiculous magical experiment. Last month a student tried to buy chickens to 'test theoretical transmutation principles.' I told him if he wanted to turn chickens into gold, he should start with fool's gold and work his way up."*
• *"Four gold pieces. Each. In advance. No credit, no payment plans, no 'my allowance comes next week.' I've heard every sob story from here to Absalom, and my heart is harder than week-old bread."*
• *"I can smell inexperience from three stalls away, and you reek of it. These birds require actual knowledge, not whatever you learned from a textbook written by someone who's never held a live chicken in their life."*

### **Market Wisdom & Experience**
• *"I've seen every type of customer in my years at these markets. You learn to read people quickly."*
• *"The key to this business is knowing your product and standing firm on quality."*
• *"Young people always think they can get something for nothing. Life doesn't work that way."*
• *"Respect earns you better deals than charm or clever words."*

### **Time Pressure & Urgency**
• *"Like I said, I sell one chick every hour. You can see other customers eyeing my stock."*
• *"Make up your minds. I have other business to attend to."*
• *"Every minute you waste negotiating is another chick gone to someone who knows a good deal when they see it."*
• *"I'm not going to hold these birds all day while you debate. Decide or move along."*

### **Professional Pride & Standards**
• *"I take pride in my work. Every bird I sell is healthy and well-bred."*
• *"I've built my reputation on quality and fair dealing. That's worth more than quick profits."*
• *"I don't sell sick birds or pass off inferior stock as premium. My name means something in this business."*
• *"When you buy from me, you're getting expertise along with the livestock."*

### **Practical Warnings & Reality Checks**
• *"Don't think this is going to be easy money. Raising chickens is real work."*
• *"If you're not prepared for the responsibility, don't waste my time or the birds' lives."*
• *"These chicks will die if you don't know what you're doing. Are you sure you're ready for that responsibility?"*
• *"I'm not responsible for what happens after you leave my stall. The birds' welfare is in your hands then."*
