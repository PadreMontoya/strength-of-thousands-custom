# Foundry Module Guidelines

I've created a github repo at https://github.com/PadreMontoya/strength-of-thousands-custom

Please create a foundry module for the Strength of Thousands campaign in the ./Foundry folder.  The module should include the following:

- A "Year of the Initiate" journal, as described in ./foundry/docs/book2-year-of-the-initiate-draft.md
- A "Magaambya NPCs" journal, as described in ./foundry/docs/book2-Magaambya-NPCs.md
- Items for each NPC that has a Friendship Bead

When permissions are relevant, player IDs are below:

GM - Anthony Gill: 6M4FFhxdKoWoOC9z
Player - Scott (Character: Mouse the Minotaur Animist): BVtcoqtR5hDV73fr
Player - Joe (Character: Dorren the Human Magus): Rtjc27Wkzogg0m4w
Player - Emily (Character: Zyshi the Anadi Psychic): QM1wwiuuC4Lkl9dU
Player - Jen (Character: Izzy the Human Dragonblood Sorceror): mLpzP30Ezig8iEjr

Specifics are below:

Ensure you only show content that is player friendly when creating items that are visible to players.  For GM only content, use content formatted like this:

<div data-visibility="gm">
    <p>Secret Text</p>
</div>

## Year of the Initiate Journal

This journal is visible to both players and GMs.  The GM notes, information about events and other GM-only information should be hidden from players.  Players will use this guide to get a feel for a location before choosing one to explore.

## Magaambya NPCs Journal

This journal is visible to both players and GMs.  The GM notes should be hidden from players.  Players can use this journal to learn more about the NPCs they meet at the Magaambya.

Each page should have the character's name and branch in the page name, e.g. "Anchor Root (Rain-Scribe)"

The players should be able to see:
- gender
- race
- class
- notable skills
- hobbies
- description
- personality

The following are for the GM only:
- key character traits
- things they might say
- speech mannerisms
- physical mannerisms
- role & abilities

The following should be made into a separate item entry, then linked onto the journal for easy drag/drop onto a player awarded the item:
- friendship bead title  (e.g. "Bead from Anchor Root") (if applicable)
- description
- friendship benefits (if applicable)
- topics they can help with (if applicable)

Also create a few other generic beads to represent the ones the players may have already collected in PZO90169 002-059 Adventure.txt.  All beads have a value of 1sp.
